A
Beginning
Every
author
has
some
peculiarity
in
his
descriptions
or
in
his
style
of
writing.
Those
who
do
not
like
him,
magnify
it,
shrug
up
their
shoulders,
and
exclaim--there
he
is
again!
I,
for
my
part,
know
very
well
how
I
can
bring
about
this
movement
and
this
exclamation.
It
would
happen
immediately
if
I
were
to
begin
here,
as
I
intended
to
do,
with:
"Rome
has
its
Corso,
Naples
its
Toledo"--"Ah!
that
Andersen;
there
he
is
again!"
they
would
cry;
yet
I
must,
to
please
my
fancy,
continue
quite
quietly,
and
add:
"But
Copenhagen
has
its
East
Street."
Here,
then,
we
will
stay
for
the
present.
In
one
of
the
houses
not
far
from
the
new
market
a
party
was
invited--a
very
large
party,
in
order,
as
is
often
the
case,
to
get
a
return
invitation
from
the
others.
One
half
of
the
company
was
already
seated
at
the
card-table,
the
other
half
awaited
the
result
of
the
stereotype
preliminary
observation
of
the
lady
of
the
house:
"Now
let
us
see
what
we
can
do
to
amuse
ourselves."
They
had
got
just
so
far,
and
the
conversation
began
to
crystallise,
as
it
could
but
do
with
the
scanty
stream
which
the
commonplace
world
supplied.
Amongst
other
things
they
spoke
of
the
middle
ages:
some
praised
that
period
as
far
more
interesting,
far
more
poetical
than
our
own
too
sober
present;
indeed
Councillor
Knap
defended
this
opinion
so
warmly,
that
the
hostess
declared
immediately
on
his
side,
and
both
exerted
themselves
with
unwearied
eloquence.
The
Councillor
boldly
declared
the
time
of
King
Hans
to
be
the
noblest
and
the
most
happy
period.*

A.D.
1482-1513
While
the
conversation
turned
on
this
subject,
and
was
only
for
a
moment
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
journal
that
contained
nothing
worth
reading,
we
will
just
step
out
into
the
antechamber,
where
cloaks,
mackintoshes,
sticks,
umbrellas,
and
shoes,
were
deposited.
Here
sat
two
female
figures,
a
young
and
an
old
one.
One
might
have
thought
at
first
they
were
servants
come
to
accompany
their
mistresses
home;
but
on
looking
nearer,
one
soon
saw
they
could
scarcely
be
mere
servants;
their
forms
were
too
noble
for
that,
their
skin
too
fine,
the
cut
of
their
dress
too
striking.
Two
fairies
were
they;
the
younger,
it
is
true,
was
not
Dame
Fortune
herself,
but
one
of
the
waiting-maids
of
her
handmaidens
who
carry
about
the
lesser
good
things
that
she
distributes;
the
other
looked
extremely
gloomy--it
was
Care.
She
always
attends
to
her
own
serious
business
herself,
as
then
she
is
sure
of
having
it
done
properly.
They
were
telling
each
other,
with
a
confidential
interchange
of
ideas,
where
they
had
been
during
the
day.
The
messenger
of
Fortune
had
only
executed
a
few
unimportant
commissions,
such
as
saving
a
new
bonnet
from
a
shower
of
rain,
etc.;
but
what
she
had
yet
to
perform
was
something
quite
unusual.
"I
must
tell
you,"
said
she,
"that
to-day
is
my
birthday;
and
in
honor
of
it,
a
pair
of
walking-shoes
or
galoshes
has
been
entrusted
to
me,
which
I
am
to
carry
to
mankind.
These
shoes
possess
the
property
of
instantly
transporting
him
who
has
them
on
to
the
place
or
the
period
in
which
he
most
wishes
to
be;
every
wish,
as
regards
time
or
place,
or
state
of
being,
will
be
immediately
fulfilled,
and
so
at
last
man
will
be
happy,
here
below."
"Do
you
seriously
believe
it?"
replied
Care,
in
a
severe
tone
of
reproach.
"No;
he
will
be
very
unhappy,
and
will
assuredly
bless
the
moment
when
he
feels
that
he
has
freed
himself
from
the
fatal
shoes."
"Stupid
nonsense!"
said
the
other
angrily.
"I
will
put
them
here
by
the
door.
Some
one
will
make
a
mistake
for
certain
and
take
the
wrong
ones--he
will
be
a
happy
man."
Such
was
their
conversation.
