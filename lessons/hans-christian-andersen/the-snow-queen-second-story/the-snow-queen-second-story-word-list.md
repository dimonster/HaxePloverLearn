A
Little
Boy
and
a
Little
Girl
In
a
large
town,
where
there
are
so
many
houses,
and
so
many
people,
that
there
is
no
roof
left
for
everybody
to
have
a
little
garden;
and
where,
on
this
account,
most
persons
are
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
flowers
in
pots;
there
lived
two
little
children,
who
had
a
garden
somewhat
larger
than
a
flower-pot.
They
were
not
brother
and
sister;
but
they
cared
for
each
other
as
much
as
if
they
were.
Their
parents
lived
exactly
opposite.
They
inhabited
two
garrets;
and
where
the
roof
of
the
one
house
joined
that
of
the
other,
and
the
gutter
ran
along
the
extreme
end
of
it,
there
was
to
each
house
a
small
window:
one
needed
only
to
step
over
the
gutter
to
get
from
one
window
to
the
other.
The
children's
parents
had
large
wooden
boxes
there,
in
which
vegetables
for
the
kitchen
were
planted,
and
little
rosetrees
besides:
there
was
a
rose
in
each
box,
and
they
grew
splendidly.
They
now
thought
of
placing
the
boxes
across
the
gutter,
so
that
they
nearly
reached
from
one
window
to
the
other,
and
looked
just
like
two
walls
of
flowers.
The
tendrils
of
the
peas
hung
down
over
the
boxes;
and
the
rose-trees
shot
up
long
branches,
twined
round
the
windows,
and
then
bent
towards
each
other:
it
was
almost
like
a
triumphant
arch
of
foliage
and
flowers.
The
boxes
were
very
high,
and
the
children
knew
that
they
must
not
creep
over
them;
so
they
often
obtained
permission
to
get
out
of
the
windows
to
each
other,
and
to
sit
on
their
little
stools
among
the
roses,
where
they
could
play
delightfully.
In
winter
there
was
an
end
of
this
pleasure.
The
windows
were
often
frozen
over;
but
then
they
heated
copper
farthings
on
the
stove,
and
laid
the
hot
farthing
on
the
windowpane,
and
then
they
had
a
capital
peep-hole,
quite
nicely
rounded;
and
out
of
each
peeped
a
gentle
friendly
eye--it
was
the
little
boy
and
the
little
girl
who
were
looking
out.
His
name
was
Kay,
hers
was
Gerda.
In
summer,
with
one
jump,
they
could
get
to
each
other;
but
in
winter
they
were
obliged
first
to
go
down
the
long
stairs,
and
then
up
the
long
stairs
again:
and
out-of-doors
there
was
quite
a
snow-storm.
"It
is
the
white
bees
that
are
swarming,"
said
Kay's
old
grandmother.
"Do
the
white
bees
choose
a
queen?"
asked
the
little
boy;
for
he
knew
that
the
honey-bees
always
have
one.
"Yes,"
said
the
grandmother,
"she
flies
where
the
swarm
hangs
in
the
thickest
clusters.
She
is
the
largest
of
all;
and
she
can
never
remain
quietly
on
the
earth,
but
goes
up
again
into
the
black
clouds.
Many
a
winter's
night
she
flies
through
the
streets
of
the
town,
and
peeps
in
at
the
windows;
and
they
then
freeze
in
so
wondrous
a
manner
that
they
look
like
flowers."
"Yes,
I
have
seen
it,"
said
both
the
children;
and
so
they
knew
that
it
was
true.
"Can
the
Snow
Queen
come
in?"
said
the
little
girl.
"Only
let
her
come
in!"
said
the
little
boy.
"Then
I'd
put
her
on
the
stove,
and
she'd
melt."
And
then
his
grandmother
patted
his
head
and
told
him
other
stories.
In
the
evening,
when
little
Kay
was
at
home,
and
half
undressed,
he
climbed
up
on
the
chair
by
the
window,
and
peeped
out
of
the
little
hole.
A
few
snow-flakes
were
falling,
and
one,
the
largest
of
all,
remained
lying
on
the
edge
of
a
flower-pot.
The
flake
of
snow
grew
larger
and
larger;
and
at
last
it
was
like
a
young
lady,
dressed
in
the
finest
white
gauze,
made
of
a
million
little
flakes
like
stars.
She
was
so
beautiful
and
delicate,
but
she
was
of
ice,
of
dazzling,
sparkling
ice;
yet
she
lived;
her
eyes
gazed
fixedly,
like
two
stars;
but
there
was
neither
quiet
nor
repose
in
them.
She
nodded
towards
the
window,
and
beckoned
with
her
hand.
The
little
boy
was
frightened,
and
jumped
down
from
the
chair;
it
seemed
to
him
as
if,
at
the
same
moment,
a
large
bird
flew
past
the
window.
The
next
day
it
was
a
sharp
frost--and
then
the
spring
came;
the
sun
shone,
the
green
leaves
appeared,
the
swallows
built
their
nests,
the
windows
were
opened,
and
the
little
children
again
sat
in
their
pretty
garden,
high
up
on
the
leads
at
the
top
of
the
house.
That
summer
the
roses
flowered
in
unwonted
beauty.
The
little
girl
had
learned
a
hymn,
in
which
there
was
something
about
roses;
and
then
she
thought
of
her
own
flowers;
and
she
sang
the
verse
to
the
little
boy,
who
then
sang
it
with
her:
"The
rose
in
the
valley
is
blooming
so
sweet,
And
angels
descend
there
the
children
to
greet."
And
the
children
held
each
other
by
the
hand,
kissed
the
roses,
looked
up
at
the
clear
sunshine,
and
spoke
as
though
they
really
saw
angels
there.
What
lovely
summer-days
those
were!
How
delightful
to
be
out
in
the
air,
near
the
fresh
rose-bushes,
that
seem
as
if
they
would
never
finish
blossoming!
Kay
and
Gerda
looked
at
the
picture-book
full
of
beasts
and
of
birds;
and
it
was
then--the
clock
in
the
church-tower
was
just
striking
five--that
Kay
said,
"Oh!
I
feel
such
a
sharp
pain
in
my
heart;
and
now
something
has
got
into
my
eye!"
The
little
girl
put
her
arms
around
his
neck.
He
winked
his
eyes;
now
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen.
"I
think
it
is
out
now,"
said
he;
but
it
was
not.
It
was
just
one
of
those
pieces
of
glass
from
the
magic
mirror
that
had
got
into
his
eye;
and
poor
Kay
had
got
another
piece
right
in
his
heart.
It
will
soon
become
like
ice.
It
did
not
hurt
any
longer,
but
there
it
was.
"What
are
you
crying
for?"
asked
he.
"You
look
so
ugly!
There's
nothing
the
matter
with
me.
Ah,"
said
he
at
once,
"that
rose
is
cankered!
And
look,
this
one
is
quite
crooked!
After
all,
these
roses
are
very
ugly!
They
are
just
like
the
box
they
are
planted
in!"
And
then
he
gave
the
box
a
good
kick
with
his
foot,
and
pulled
both
the
roses
up.
"What
are
you
doing?"
cried
the
little
girl;
and
as
he
perceived
her
fright,
he
pulled
up
another
rose,
got
in
at
the
window,
and
hastened
off
from
dear
little
Gerda.
Afterwards,
when
she
brought
her
picture-book,
he
asked,
"What
horrid
beasts
have
you
there?"
And
if
his
grandmother
told
them
stories,
he
always
interrupted
her;
besides,
if
he
could
manage
it,
he
would
get
behind
her,
put
on
her
spectacles,
and
imitate
her
way
of
speaking;
he
copied
all
her
ways,
and
then
everybody
laughed
at
him.
He
was
soon
able
to
imitate
the
gait
and
manner
of
everyone
in
the
street.
Everything
that
was
peculiar
and
displeasing
in
them--that
Kay
knew
how
to
imitate:
and
at
such
times
all
the
people
said,
"The
boy
is
certainly
very
clever!"
But
it
was
the
glass
he
had
got
in
his
eye;
the
glass
that
was
sticking
in
his
heart,
which
made
him
tease
even
little
Gerda,
whose
whole
soul
was
devoted
to
him.
His
games
now
were
quite
different
to
what
they
had
formerly
been,
they
were
so
very
knowing.
One
winter's
day,
when
the
flakes
of
snow
were
flying
about,
he
spread
the
skirts
of
his
blue
coat,
and
caught
the
snow
as
it
fell.
"Look
through
this
glass,
Gerda,"
said
he.
And
every
flake
seemed
larger,
and
appeared
like
a
magnificent
flower,
or
beautiful
star;
it
was
splendid
to
look
at!
"Look,
how
clever!"
said
Kay.
"That's
much
more
interesting
than
real
flowers!
They
are
as
exact
as
possible;
there
is
not
a
fault
in
them,
if
they
did
not
melt!"
It
was
not
long
after
this,
that
Kay
came
one
day
with
large
gloves
on,
and
his
little
sledge
at
his
back,
and
bawled
right
into
Gerda's
ears,
"I
have
permission
to
go
out
into
the
square
where
the
others
are
playing";
and
off
he
was
in
a
moment.
There,
in
the
market-place,
some
of
the
boldest
of
the
boys
used
to
tie
their
sledges
to
the
carts
as
they
passed
by,
and
so
they
were
pulled
along,
and
got
a
good
ride.
It
was
so
capital!
Just
as
they
were
in
the
very
height
of
their
amusement,
a
large
sledge
passed
by:
it
was
painted
quite
white,
and
there
was
someone
in
it
wrapped
up
in
a
rough
white
mantle
of
fur,
with
a
rough
white
fur
cap
on
his
head.
The
sledge
drove
round
the
square
twice,
and
Kay
tied
on
his
sledge
as
quickly
as
he
could,
and
off
he
drove
with
it.
On
they
went
quicker
and
quicker
into
the
next
street;
and
the
person
who
drove
turned
round
to
Kay,
and
nodded
to
him
in
a
friendly
manner,
just
as
if
they
knew
each
other.
Every
time
he
was
going
to
untie
his
sledge,
the
person
nodded
to
him,
and
then
Kay
sat
quiet;
and
so
on
they
went
till
they
came
outside
the
gates
of
the
town.
Then
the
snow
began
to
fall
so
thickly
that
the
little
boy
could
not
see
an
arm's
length
before
him,
but
still
on
he
went:
when
suddenly
he
let
go
the
string
he
held
in
his
hand
in
order
to
get
loose
from
the
sledge,
but
it
was
of
no
use;
still
the
little
vehicle
rushed
on
with
the
quickness
of
the
wind.
He
then
cried
as
loud
as
he
could,
but
no
one
heard
him;
the
snow
drifted
and
the
sledge
flew
on,
and
sometimes
it
gave
a
jerk
as
though
they
were
driving
over
hedges
and
ditches.
He
was
quite
frightened,
and
he
tried
to
repeat
the
Lord's
Prayer;
but
all
he
could
do,
he
was
only
able
to
remember
the
multiplication
table.
The
snow-flakes
grew
larger
and
larger,
till
at
last
they
looked
just
like
great
white
fowls.
Suddenly
they
flew
on
one
side;
the
large
sledge
stopped,
and
the
person
who
drove
rose
up.
It
was
a
lady;
her
cloak
and
cap
were
of
snow.
She
was
tall
and
of
slender
figure,
and
of
a
dazzling
whiteness.
It
was
the
Snow
Queen.
"We
have
travelled
fast,"
said
she;
"but
it
is
freezingly
cold.
Come
under
my
bearskin."
And
she
put
him
in
the
sledge
beside
her,
wrapped
the
fur
round
him,
and
he
felt
as
though
he
were
sinking
in
a
snow-wreath.
"Are
you
still
cold?"
asked
she;
and
then
she
kissed
his
forehead.
Ah!
it
was
colder
than
ice;
it
penetrated
to
his
very
heart,
which
was
already
almost
a
frozen
lump;
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
about
to
die--but
a
moment
more
and
it
was
quite
congenial
to
him,
and
he
did
not
remark
the
cold
that
was
around
him.
"My
sledge!
Do
not
forget
my
sledge!"
It
was
the
first
thing
he
thought
of.
It
was
there
tied
to
one
of
the
white
chickens,
who
flew
along
with
it
on
his
back
behind
the
large
sledge.
The
Snow
Queen
kissed
Kay
once
more,
and
then
he
forgot
little
Gerda,
grandmother,
and
all
whom
he
had
left
at
his
home.
"Now
you
will
have
no
more
kisses,"
said
she,
"or
else
I
should
kiss
you
to
death!"
Kay
looked
at
her.
She
was
very
beautiful;
a
more
clever,
or
a
more
lovely
countenance
he
could
not
fancy
to
himself;
and
she
no
longer
appeared
of
ice
as
before,
when
she
sat
outside
the
window,
and
beckoned
to
him;
in
his
eyes
she
was
perfect,
he
did
not
fear
her
at
all,
and
told
her
that
he
could
calculate
in
his
head
and
with
fractions,
even;
that
he
knew
the
number
of
square
miles
there
were
in
the
different
countries,
and
how
many
inhabitants
they
contained;
and
she
smiled
while
he
spoke.
It
then
seemed
to
him
as
if
what
he
knew
was
not
enough,
and
he
looked
upwards
in
the
large
huge
empty
space
above
him,
and
on
she
flew
with
him;
flew
high
over
the
black
clouds,
while
the
storm
moaned
and
whistled
as
though
it
were
singing
some
old
tune.
On
they
flew
over
woods
and
lakes,
over
seas,
and
many
lands;
and
beneath
them
the
chilling
storm
rushed
fast,
the
wolves
howled,
the
snow
crackled;
above
them
flew
large
screaming
crows,
but
higher
up
appeared
the
moon,
quite
large
and
bright;
and
it
was
on
it
that
Kay
gazed
during
the
long
long
winter's
night;
while
by
day
he
slept
at
the
feet
of
the
Snow
Queen.
