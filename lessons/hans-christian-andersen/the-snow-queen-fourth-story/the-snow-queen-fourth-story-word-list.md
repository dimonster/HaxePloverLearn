The
Prince
and
Princess
Gerda
was
obliged
to
rest
herself
again,
when,
exactly
opposite
to
her,
a
large
Raven
came
hopping
over
the
white
snow.
He
had
long
been
looking
at
Gerda
and
shaking
his
head;
and
now
he
said,
"Caw!
Caw!"
Good
day!
Good
day!
He
could
not
say
it
better;
but
he
felt
a
sympathy
for
the
little
girl,
and
asked
her
where
she
was
going
all
alone.
The
word
"alone"
Gerda
understood
quite
well,
and
felt
how
much
was
expressed
by
it;
so
she
told
the
Raven
her
whole
history,
and
asked
if
he
had
not
seen
Kay.
The
Raven
nodded
very
gravely,
and
said,
"It
may
be--it
may
be!"
"What,
do
you
really
think
so?"
cried
the
little
girl;
and
she
nearly
squeezed
the
Raven
to
death,
so
much
did
she
kiss
him.
"Gently,
gently,"
said
the
Raven.
"I
think
I
know;
I
think
that
it
may
be
little
Kay.
But
now
he
has
forgotten
you
for
the
Princess."
"Does
he
live
with
a
Princess?"
asked
Gerda.
"Yes--listen,"
said
the
Raven;
"but
it
will
be
difficult
for
me
to
speak
your
language.
If
you
understand
the
Raven
language
I
can
tell
you
better."
"No,
I
have
not
learnt
it,"
said
Gerda;
"but
my
grandmother
understands
it,
and
she
can
speak
gibberish
too.
I
wish
I
had
learnt
it."
"No
matter,"
said
the
Raven;
"I
will
tell
you
as
well
as
I
can;
however,
it
will
be
bad
enough."
And
then
he
told
all
he
knew.
"In
the
kingdom
where
we
now
are
there
lives
a
Princess,
who
is
extraordinarily
clever;
for
she
has
read
all
the
newspapers
in
the
whole
world,
and
has
forgotten
them
again--so
clever
is
she.
She
was
lately,
it
is
said,
sitting
on
her
throne--which
is
not
very
amusing
after
all--when
she
began
humming
an
old
tune,
and
it
was
just,
'Oh,
why
should
I
not
be
married?'
'That
song
is
not
without
its
meaning,'
said
she,
and
so
then
she
was
determined
to
marry;
but
she
would
have
a
husband
who
knew
how
to
give
an
answer
when
he
was
spoken
to--not
one
who
looked
only
as
if
he
were
a
great
personage,
for
that
is
so
tiresome.
She
then
had
all
the
ladies
of
the
court
drummed
together;
and
when
they
heard
her
intention,
all
were
very
pleased,
and
said,
'We
are
very
glad
to
hear
it;
it
is
the
very
thing
we
were
thinking
of.'
You
may
believe
every
word
I
say,"
said
the
Raven;
"for
I
have
a
tame
sweetheart
that
hops
about
in
the
palace
quite
free,
and
it
was
she
who
told
me
all
this.
"The
newspapers
appeared
forthwith
with
a
border
of
hearts
and
the
initials
of
the
Princess;
and
therein
you
might
read
that
every
good-looking
young
man
was
at
liberty
to
come
to
the
palace
and
speak
to
the
Princess;
and
he
who
spoke
in
such
wise
as
showed
he
felt
himself
at
home
there,
that
one
the
Princess
would
choose
for
her
husband.
"Yes,
Yes,"
said
the
Raven,
"you
may
believe
it;
it
is
as
true
as
I
am
sitting
here.
People
came
in
crowds;
there
was
a
crush
and
a
hurry,
but
no
one
was
successful
either
on
the
first
or
second
day.
They
could
all
talk
well
enough
when
they
were
out
in
the
street;
but
as
soon
as
they
came
inside
the
palace
gates,
and
saw
the
guard
richly
dressed
in
silver,
and
the
lackeys
in
gold
on
the
staircase,
and
the
large
illuminated
saloons,
then
they
were
abashed;
and
when
they
stood
before
the
throne
on
which
the
Princess
was
sitting,
all
they
could
do
was
to
repeat
the
last
word
they
had
uttered,
and
to
hear
it
again
did
not
interest
her
very
much.
It
was
just
as
if
the
people
within
were
under
a
charm,
and
had
fallen
into
a
trance
till
they
came
out
again
into
the
street;
for
then--oh,
then--they
could
chatter
enough.
There
was
a
whole
row
of
them
standing
from
the
town-gates
to
the
palace.
I
was
there
myself
to
look,"
said
the
Raven.
"They
grew
hungry
and
thirsty;
but
from
the
palace
they
got
nothing
whatever,
not
even
a
glass
of
water.
Some
of
the
cleverest,
it
is
true,
had
taken
bread
and
butter
with
them:
but
none
shared
it
with
his
neighbor,
for
each
thought,
'Let
him
look
hungry,
and
then
the
Princess
won't
have
him.'"
"But
Kay--little
Kay,"
said
Gerda,
"when
did
he
come?
Was
he
among
the
number?"
"Patience,
patience;
we
are
just
come
to
him.
It
was
on
the
third
day
when
a
little
personage
without
horse
or
equipage,
came
marching
right
boldly
up
to
the
palace;
his
eyes
shone
like
yours,
he
had
beautiful
long
hair,
but
his
clothes
were
very
shabby."
"That
was
Kay,"
cried
Gerda,
with
a
voice
of
delight.
"Oh,
now
I've
found
him!"
and
she
clapped
her
hands
for
joy.
"He
had
a
little
knapsack
at
his
back,"
said
the
Raven.
"No,
that
was
certainly
his
sledge,"
said
Gerda;
"for
when
he
went
away
he
took
his
sledge
with
him."
"That
may
be,"
said
the
Raven;
"I
did
not
examine
him
so
minutely;
but
I
know
from
my
tame
sweetheart,
that
when
he
came
into
the
court-yard
of
the
palace,
and
saw
the
body-guard
in
silver,
the
lackeys
on
the
staircase,
he
was
not
the
least
abashed;
he
nodded,
and
said
to
them,
'It
must
be
very
tiresome
to
stand
on
the
stairs;
for
my
part,
I
shall
go
in.'
The
saloons
were
gleaming
with
lustres--privy
councillors
and
excellencies
were
walking
about
barefooted,
and
wore
gold
keys;
it
was
enough
to
make
any
one
feel
uncomfortable.
His
boots
creaked,
too,
so
loudly,
but
still
he
was
not
at
all
afraid."
"That's
Kay
for
certain,"
said
Gerda.
"I
know
he
had
on
new
boots;
I
have
heard
them
creaking
in
grandmama's
room."
"Yes,
they
creaked,"
said
the
Raven.
"And
on
he
went
boldly
up
to
the
Princess,
who
was
sitting
on
a
pearl
as
large
as
a
spinning-wheel.
All
the
ladies
of
the
court,
with
their
attendants
and
attendants'
attendants,
and
all
the
cavaliers,
with
their
gentlemen
and
gentlemen's
gentlemen,
stood
round;
and
the
nearer
they
stood
to
the
door,
the
prouder
they
looked.
It
was
hardly
possible
to
look
at
the
gentleman's
gentleman,
so
very
haughtily
did
he
stand
in
the
doorway."
"It
must
have
been
terrible,"
said
little
Gerda.
"And
did
Kay
get
the
Princess?"
"Were
I
not
a
Raven,
I
should
have
taken
the
Princess
myself,
although
I
am
promised.
It
is
said
he
spoke
as
well
as
I
speak
when
I
talk
Raven
language;
this
I
learned
from
my
tame
sweetheart.
He
was
bold
and
nicely
behaved;
he
had
not
come
to
woo
the
Princess,
but
only
to
hear
her
wisdom.
She
pleased
him,
and
he
pleased
her."
"Yes,
yes;
for
certain
that
was
Kay,"
said
Gerda.
"He
was
so
clever;
he
could
reckon
fractions
in
his
head.
Oh,
won't
you
take
me
to
the
palace?"
"That
is
very
easily
said,"
answered
the
Raven.
"But
how
are
we
to
manage
it?
I'll
speak
to
my
tame
sweetheart
about
it:
she
must
advise
us;
for
so
much
I
must
tell
you,
such
a
little
girl
as
you
are
will
never
get
permission
to
enter."
"Oh,
yes
I
shall,"
said
Gerda;
"when
Kay
hears
that
I
am
here,
he
will
come
out
directly
to
fetch
me."
"Wait
for
me
here
on
these
steps,"
said
the
Raven.
He
moved
his
head
backwards
and
forwards
and
flew
away.
The
evening
was
closing
in
when
the
Raven
returned.
"Caw--caw!"
said
he.
"She
sends
you
her
compliments;
and
here
is
a
roll
for
you.
She
took
it
out
of
the
kitchen,
where
there
is
bread
enough.
You
are
hungry,
no
doubt.
It
is
not
possible
for
you
to
enter
the
palace,
for
you
are
barefooted:
the
guards
in
silver,
and
the
lackeys
in
gold,
would
not
allow
it;
but
do
not
cry,
you
shall
come
in
still.
My
sweetheart
knows
a
little
back
stair
that
leads
to
the
bedchamber,
and
she
knows
where
she
can
get
the
key
of
it."
And
they
went
into
the
garden
in
the
large
avenue,
where
one
leaf
was
falling
after
the
other;
and
when
the
lights
in
the
palace
had
all
gradually
disappeared,
the
Raven
led
little
Gerda
to
the
back
door,
which
stood
half
open.
Oh,
how
Gerda's
heart
beat
with
anxiety
and
longing!
It
was
just
as
if
she
had
been
about
to
do
something
wrong;
and
yet
she
only
wanted
to
know
if
little
Kay
was
there.
Yes,
he
must
be
there.
She
called
to
mind
his
intelligent
eyes,
and
his
long
hair,
so
vividly,
she
could
quite
see
him
as
he
used
to
laugh
when
they
were
sitting
under
the
roses
at
home.
"He
will,
no
doubt,
be
glad
to
see
you--to
hear
what
a
long
way
you
have
come
for
his
sake;
to
know
how
unhappy
all
at
home
were
when
he
did
not
come
back."
Oh,
what
a
fright
and
a
joy
it
was!
They
were
now
on
the
stairs.
A
single
lamp
was
burning
there;
and
on
the
floor
stood
the
tame
Raven,
turning
her
head
on
every
side
and
looking
at
Gerda,
who
bowed
as
her
grandmother
had
taught
her
to
do.
"My
intended
has
told
me
so
much
good
of
you,
my
dear
young
lady,"
said
the
tame
Raven.
"Your
tale
is
very
affecting.
If
you
will
take
the
lamp,
I
will
go
before.
We
will
go
straight
on,
for
we
shall
meet
no
one."
"I
think
there
is
somebody
just
behind
us,"
said
Gerda;
and
something
rushed
past:
it
was
like
shadowy
figures
on
the
wall;
horses
with
flowing
manes
and
thin
legs,
huntsmen,
ladies
and
gentlemen
on
horseback.
"They
are
only
dreams,"
said
the
Raven.
"They
come
to
fetch
the
thoughts
of
the
high
personages
to
the
chase;
'tis
well,
for
now
you
can
observe
them
in
bed
all
the
better.
But
let
me
find,
when
you
enjoy
honor
and
distinction,
that
you
possess
a
grateful
heart."
"Tut!
That's
not
worth
talking
about,"
said
the
Raven
of
the
woods.
They
now
entered
the
first
saloon,
which
was
of
rose-colored
satin,
with
artificial
flowers
on
the
wall.
Here
the
dreams
were
rushing
past,
but
they
hastened
by
so
quickly
that
Gerda
could
not
see
the
high
personages.
One
hall
was
more
magnificent
than
the
other;
one
might
indeed
well
be
abashed;
and
at
last
they
came
into
the
bedchamber.
The
ceiling
of
the
room
resembled
a
large
palm-tree
with
leaves
of
glass,
of
costly
glass;
and
in
the
middle,
from
a
thick
golden
stem,
hung
two
beds,
each
of
which
resembled
a
lily.
One
was
white,
and
in
this
lay
the
Princess;
the
other
was
red,
and
it
was
here
that
Gerda
was
to
look
for
little
Kay.
She
bent
back
one
of
the
red
leaves,
and
saw
a
brown
neck.
Oh!
that
was
Kay!
She
called
him
quite
loud
by
name,
held
the
lamp
towards
him--the
dreams
rushed
back
again
into
the
chamber--he
awoke,
turned
his
head,
and--it
was
not
little
Kay!
The
Prince
was
only
like
him
about
the
neck;
but
he
was
young
and
handsome.
And
out
of
the
white
lily
leaves
the
Princess
peeped,
too,
and
asked
what
was
the
matter.
Then
little
Gerda
cried,
and
told
her
her
whole
history,
and
all
that
the
Ravens
had
done
for
her.
"Poor
little
thing!"
said
the
Prince
and
the
Princess.
They
praised
the
Ravens
very
much,
and
told
them
they
were
not
at
all
angry
with
them,
but
they
were
not
to
do
so
again.
However,
they
should
have
a
reward.
"Will
you
fly
about
here
at
liberty,"
asked
the
Princess;
"or
would
you
like
to
have
a
fixed
appointment
as
court
ravens,
with
all
the
broken
bits
from
the
kitchen?"
And
both
the
Ravens
nodded,
and
begged
for
a
fixed
appointment;
for
they
thought
of
their
old
age,
and
said,
"It
is
a
good
thing
to
have
a
provision
for
our
old
days."
And
the
Prince
got
up
and
let
Gerda
sleep
in
his
bed,
and
more
than
this
he
could
not
do.
She
folded
her
little
hands
and
thought,
"How
good
men
and
animals
are!"
and
she
then
fell
asleep
and
slept
soundly.
All
the
dreams
flew
in
again,
and
they
now
looked
like
the
angels;
they
drew
a
little
sledge,
in
which
little
Kay
sat
and
nodded
his
head;
but
the
whole
was
only
a
dream,
and
therefore
it
all
vanished
as
soon
as
she
awoke.
The
next
day
she
was
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
silk
and
velvet.
They
offered
to
let
her
stay
at
the
palace,
and
lead
a
happy
life;
but
she
begged
to
have
a
little
carriage
with
a
horse
in
front,
and
for
a
small
pair
of
shoes;
then,
she
said,
she
would
again
go
forth
in
the
wide
world
and
look
for
Kay.
Shoes
and
a
muff
were
given
her;
she
was,
too,
dressed
very
nicely;
and
when
she
was
about
to
set
off,
a
new
carriage
stopped
before
the
door.
It
was
of
pure
gold,
and
the
arms
of
the
Prince
and
Princess
shone
like
a
star
upon
it;
the
coachman,
the
footmen,
and
the
outriders,
for
outriders
were
there,
too,
all
wore
golden
crowns.
The
Prince
and
the
Princess
assisted
her
into
the
carriage
themselves,
and
wished
her
all
success.
The
Raven
of
the
woods,
who
was
now
married,
accompanied
her
for
the
first
three
miles.
He
sat
beside
Gerda,
for
he
could
not
bear
riding
backwards;
the
other
Raven
stood
in
the
doorway,
and
flapped
her
wings;
she
could
not
accompany
Gerda,
because
she
suffered
from
headache
since
she
had
had
a
fixed
appointment
and
ate
so
much.
The
carriage
was
lined
inside
with
sugar-plums,
and
in
the
seats
were
fruits
and
gingerbread.
"Farewell!
Farewell!"
cried
Prince
and
Princess;
and
Gerda
wept,
and
the
Raven
wept.
Thus
passed
the
first
miles;
and
then
the
Raven
bade
her
farewell,
and
this
was
the
most
painful
separation
of
all.
He
flew
into
a
tree,
and
beat
his
black
wings
as
long
as
he
could
see
the
carriage,
that
shone
from
afar
like
a
sunbeam.
