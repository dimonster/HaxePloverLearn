A
Moment
of
Head
Importance--An
Evening's
"Dramatic
Readings"--A
Most
Strange
Journey
Every
inhabitant
of
Copenhagen
knows,
from
personal
inspection,
how
the
entrance
to
Frederick's
Hospital
looks;
but
as
it
is
possible
that
others,
who
are
not
Copenhagen
people,
may
also
read
this
little
work,
we
will
beforehand
give
a
short
description
of
it.
The
extensive
building
is
separated
from
the
street
by
a
pretty
high
railing,
the
thick
iron
bars
of
which
are
so
far
apart,
that
in
all
seriousness,
it
is
said,
some
very
thin
fellow
had
of
a
night
occasionally
squeezed
himself
through
to
go
and
pay
his
little
visits
in
the
town.
The
part
of
the
body
most
difficult
to
manage
on
such
occasions
was,
no
doubt,
the
head;
here,
as
is
so
often
the
case
in
the
world,
long-headed
people
get
through
best.
So
much,
then,
for
the
introduction.
One
of
the
young
men,
whose
head,
in
a
physical
sense
only,
might
be
said
to
be
of
the
thickest,
had
the
watch
that
evening.
The
rain
poured
down
in
torrents;
yet
despite
these
two
obstacles,
the
young
man
was
obliged
to
go
out,
if
it
were
but
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour;
and
as
to
telling
the
door-keeper
about
it,
that,
he
thought,
was
quite
unnecessary,
if,
with
a
whole
skin,
he
were
able
to
slip
through
the
railings.
There,
on
the
floor
lay
the
galoshes,
which
the
watchman
had
forgotten;
he
never
dreamed
for
a
moment
that
they
were
those
of
Fortune;
and
they
promised
to
do
him
good
service
in
the
wet;
so
he
put
them
on.
The
question
now
was,
if
he
could
squeeze
himself
through
the
grating,
for
he
had
never
tried
before.
Well,
there
he
stood.
"Would
to
Heaven
I
had
got
my
head
through!"
said
he,
involuntarily;
and
instantly
through
it
slipped,
easily
and
without
pain,
notwithstanding
it
was
pretty
large
and
thick.
But
now
the
rest
of
the
body
was
to
be
got
through!
"Ah!
I
am
much
too
stout,"
groaned
he
aloud,
while
fixed
as
in
a
vice.
"I
had
thought
the
head
was
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
matter--oh!
oh!
I
really
cannot
squeeze
myself
through!"
He
now
wanted
to
pull
his
over-hasty
head
back
again,
but
he
could
not.
For
his
neck
there
was
room
enough,
but
for
nothing
more.
His
first
feeling
was
of
anger;
his
next
that
