The
Little
Robber
Maiden
They
drove
through
the
dark
wood;
but
the
carriage
shone
like
a
torch,
and
it
dazzled
the
eyes
of
the
robbers,
so
that
they
could
not
bear
to
look
at
it.
"'Tis
gold!
'Tis
gold!"
they
cried;
and
they
rushed
forward,
seized
the
horses,
knocked
down
the
little
postilion,
the
coachman,
and
the
servants,
and
pulled
little
Gerda
out
of
the
carriage.
"How
plump,
how
beautiful
she
is!
She
must
have
been
fed
on
nut-kernels,"
said
the
old
female
robber,
who
had
a
long,
scrubby
beard,
and
bushy
eyebrows
that
hung
down
over
her
eyes.
"She
is
as
good
as
a
fatted
lamb!
How
nice
she
will
be!"
And
then
she
drew
out
a
knife,
the
blade
of
which
shone
so
that
it
was
quite
dreadful
to
behold.
"Oh!"
cried
the
woman
at
the
same
moment.
She
had
been
bitten
in
the
ear
by
her
own
little
daughter,
who
hung
at
her
back;
and
who
was
so
wild
and
unmanageable,
that
it
was
quite
amusing
to
see
her.
"You
naughty
child!"
said
the
mother:
and
now
she
had
not
time
to
kill
Gerda.
"She
shall
play
with
me,"
said
the
little
robber
child.
"She
shall
give
me
her
muff,
and
her
pretty
frock;
she
shall
sleep
in
my
bed!"
And
then
she
gave
her
mother
another
bite,
so
that
she
jumped,
and
ran
round
with
the
pain;
and
the
Robbers
laughed,
and
said,
"Look,
how
she
is
dancing
with
the
little
one!"
"I
will
go
into
the
carriage,"
said
the
little
robber
maiden;
and
she
would
have
her
will,
for
she
was
very
spoiled
and
very
headstrong.
She
and
Gerda
got
in;
and
then
away
they
drove
over
the
stumps
of
felled
trees,
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
woods.
The
little
robber
maiden
was
as
tall
as
Gerda,
but
stronger,
broader-shouldered,
and
of
dark
complexion;
her
eyes
were
quite
black;
they
looked
almost
melancholy.
She
embraced
little
Gerda,
and
said,
"They
shall
not
kill
you
as
long
as
I
am
not
displeased
with
you.
You
are,
doubtless,
a
Princess?"
"No,"
said
little
Gerda;
who
then
related
all
that
had
happened
to
her,
and
how
much
she
cared
about
little
Kay.
The
little
robber
maiden
looked
at
her
with
a
serious
air,
nodded
her
head
slightly,
and
said,
"They
shall
not
kill
you,
even
if
I
am
angry
with
you:
then
I
will
do
it
myself";
and
she
dried
Gerda's
eyes,
and
put
both
her
hands
in
the
handsome
muff,
which
was
so
soft
and
warm.
At
length
the
carriage
stopped.
They
were
in
the
midst
of
the
court-yard
of
a
robber's
castle.
It
was
full
of
cracks
from
top
to
bottom;
and
out
of
the
openings
magpies
and
rooks
were
flying;
and
the
great
bull-dogs,
each
of
which
looked
as
if
he
could
swallow
a
man,
jumped
up,
but
they
did
not
bark,
for
that
was
forbidden.
In
the
midst
of
the
large,
old,
smoking
hall
burnt
a
great
fire
on
the
stone
floor.
The
smoke
disappeared
under
the
stones,
and
had
to
seek
its
own
egress.
In
an
immense
caldron
soup
was
boiling;
and
rabbits
and
hares
were
being
roasted
on
a
spit.
"You
shall
sleep
with
me
to-night,
with
all
my
animals,"
said
the
little
robber
maiden.
They
had
something
to
eat
and
drink;
and
then
went
into
a
corner,
where
straw
and
carpets
were
lying.
Beside
them,
on
laths
and
perches,
sat
nearly
a
hundred
pigeons,
all
asleep,
seemingly;
but
yet
they
moved
a
little
when
the
robber
maiden
came.
"They
are
all
mine,"
said
she,
at
the
same
time
seizing
one
that
was
next
to
her
by
the
legs
and
shaking
it
so
that
its
wings
fluttered.
"Kiss
it,"
cried
the
little
girl,
and
flung
the
pigeon
in
Gerda's
face.
"Up
there
is
the
rabble
of
the
wood,"
continued
she,
pointing
to
several
laths
which
were
fastened
before
a
hole
high
up
in
the
wall;
"that's
the
rabble;
they
would
all
fly
away
immediately,
if
they
were
not
well
fastened
in.
And
here
is
my
dear
old
Bac";
and
she
laid
hold
of
the
horns
of
a
reindeer,
that
had
a
bright
copper
ring
round
its
neck,
and
was
tethered
to
the
spot.
"We
are
obliged
to
lock
this
fellow
in
too,
or
he
would
make
his
escape.
Every
evening
I
tickle
his
neck
with
my
sharp
knife;
he
is
so
frightened
at
it!"
and
the
little
girl
drew
forth
a
long
knife,
from
a
crack
in
the
wall,
and
let
it
glide
over
the
Reindeer's
neck.
The
poor
animal
kicked;
the
girl
laughed,
and
pulled
Gerda
into
bed
with
her.
"Do
you
intend
to
keep
your
knife
while
you
sleep?"
asked
Gerda;
looking
at
it
rather
fearfully.
"I
always
sleep
with
the
knife,"
said
the
little
robber
maiden.
"There
is
no
knowing
what
may
happen.
But
tell
me
now,
once
more,
all
about
little
Kay;
and
why
you
have
started
off
in
the
wide
world
alone."
And
Gerda
related
all,
from
the
very
beginning:
the
Wood-pigeons
cooed
above
in
their
cage,
and
the
others
slept.
The
little
robber
maiden
wound
her
arm
round
Gerda's
neck,
held
the
knife
in
the
other
hand,
and
snored
so
loud
that
everybody
could
hear
her;
but
Gerda
could
not
close
her
eyes,
for
she
did
not
know
whether
she
was
to
live
or
die.
The
robbers
sat
round
the
fire,
sang
and
drank;
and
the
old
female
robber
jumped
about
so,
that
it
was
quite
dreadful
for
Gerda
to
see
her.
Then
the
Wood-pigeons
said,
"Coo!
Coo!
We
have
seen
little
Kay!
A
white
hen
carries
his
sledge;
he
himself
sat
in
the
carriage
of
the
Snow
Queen,
who
passed
here,
down
just
over
the
wood,
as
we
lay
in
our
nest.
She
blew
upon
us
young
ones;
and
all
died
except
we
two.
Coo!
Coo!"
"What
is
that
you
say
up
there?"
cried
little
Gerda.
"Where
did
the
Snow
Queen
go
to?
Do
you
know
anything
about
it?"
"She
is
no
doubt
gone
to
Lapland;
for
there
is
always
snow
and
ice
there.
Only
ask
the
Reindeer,
who
is
tethered
there."
"Ice
and
snow
is
there!
There
it
is,
glorious
and
beautiful!"
said
the
Reindeer.
"One
can
spring
about
in
the
large
shining
valleys!
The
Snow
Queen
has
her
summer-tent
there;
but
her
fixed
abode
is
high
up
towards
the
North
Pole,
on
the
Island
called
Spitzbergen."
"Oh,
Kay!
Poor
little
Kay!"
sighed
Gerda.
"Do
you
choose
to
be
quiet?"
said
the
robber
maiden.
"If
you
don't,
I
shall
make
you."
In
the
morning
Gerda
told
her
all
that
the
Wood-pigeons
had
said;
and
the
little
maiden
looked
very
serious,
but
she
nodded
her
head,
and
said,
"That's
no
matter--that's
no
matter.
Do
you
know
where
Lapland
lies!"
she
asked
of
the
Reindeer.
"Who
should
know
better
than
I?"
said
the
animal;
and
his
eyes
rolled
in
his
head.
"I
was
born
and
bred
there--there
I
leapt
about
on
the
fields
of
snow."
"Listen,"
said
the
robber
maiden
to
Gerda.
"You
see
that
the
men
are
gone;
but
my
mother
is
still
here,
and
will
remain.
However,
towards
morning
she
takes
a
draught
out
of
the
large
flask,
and
then
she
sleeps
a
little:
then
I
will
do
something
for
you."
She
now
jumped
out
of
bed,
flew
to
her
mother;
with
her
arms
round
her
neck,
and
pulling
her
by
the
beard,
said,
"Good
morrow,
my
own
sweet
nanny-goat
of
a
mother."
And
her
mother
took
hold
of
her
nose,
and
pinched
it
till
it
was
red
and
blue;
but
this
was
all
done
out
of
pure
love.
When
the
mother
had
taken
a
sup
at
her
flask,
and
was
having
a
nap,
the
little
robber
maiden
went
to
the
Reindeer,
and
said,
"I
should
very
much
like
to
give
you
still
many
a
tickling
with
the
sharp
knife,
for
then
you
are
so
amusing;
however,
I
will
untether
you,
and
help
you
out,
so
that
you
may
go
back
to
Lapland.
But
you
must
make
good
use
of
your
legs;
and
take
this
little
girl
for
me
to
the
palace
of
the
Snow
Queen,
where
her
playfellow
is.
You
have
heard,
I
suppose,
all
she
said;
for
she
spoke
loud
enough,
and
you
were
listening."
The
Reindeer
gave
a
bound
for
joy.
The
robber
maiden
lifted
up
little
Gerda,
and
took
the
precaution
to
bind
her
fast
on
the
Reindeer's
back;
she
even
gave
her
a
small
cushion
to
sit
on.
"Here
are
your
worsted
leggins,
for
it
will
be
cold;
but
the
muff
I
shall
keep
for
myself,
for
it
is
so
very
pretty.
But
I
do
not
wish
you
to
be
cold.
Here
is
a
pair
of
lined
gloves
of
my
mother's;
they
just
reach
up
to
your
elbow.
On
with
them!
Now
you
look
about
the
hands
just
like
my
ugly
old
mother!"
And
Gerda
wept
for
joy.
"I
can't
bear
to
see
you
fretting,"
said
the
little
robber
maiden.
"This
is
just
the
time
when
you
ought
to
look
pleased.
Here
are
two
loaves
and
a
ham
for
you,
so
that
you
won't
starve."
The
bread
and
the
meat
were
fastened
to
the
Reindeer's
back;
the
little
maiden
opened
the
door,
called
in
all
the
dogs,
and
then
with
her
knife
cut
the
rope
that
fastened
the
animal,
and
said
to
him,
"Now,
off
with
you;
but
take
good
care
of
the
little
girl!"
And
Gerda
stretched
out
her
hands
with
the
large
wadded
gloves
towards
the
robber
maiden,
and
said,
"Farewell!"
and
the
Reindeer
flew
on
over
bush
and
bramble
through
the
great
wood,
over
moor
and
heath,
as
fast
as
he
could
go.
"Ddsa!
Ddsa!"
was
heard
in
the
sky.
It
was
just
as
if
somebody
was
sneezing.
"These
are
my
old
northern-lights,"
said
the
Reindeer,
"look
how
they
gleam!"
And
on
he
now
sped
still
quicker--day
and
night
on
he
went:
the
loaves
were
consumed,
and
the
ham
too;
and
now
they
were
in
Lapland.
