What
Happened
to
the
Councillor
It
was
late;
Councillor
Knap,
deeply
occupied
with
the
times
of
King
Hans,
intended
to
go
home,
and
malicious
Fate
managed
matters
so
that
his
feet,
instead
of
finding
their
way
to
his
own
galoshes,
slipped
into
those
of
Fortune.
Thus
caparisoned
the
good
man
walked
out
of
the
well-lighted
rooms
into
East
Street.
By
the
magic
power
of
the
shoes
he
was
carried
back
to
the
times
of
King
Hans;
on
which
account
his
foot
very
naturally
sank
in
the
mud
and
puddles
of
the
street,
there
having
been
in
those
days
no
pavement
in
Copenhagen.
"Well!
This
is
too
bad!
How
dirty
it
is
here!"
sighed
the
Councillor.
"As
to
a
pavement,
I
can
find
no
traces
of
one,
and
all
the
lamps,
it
seems,
have
gone
to
sleep."
The
moon
was
not
yet
very
high;
it
was
besides
rather
foggy,
so
that
in
the
darkness
all
objects
seemed
mingled
in
chaotic
confusion.
At
the
next
corner
hung
a
votive
lamp
before
a
Madonna,
but
the
light
it
gave
was
little
better
than
none
at
all;
indeed,
he
did
not
observe
it
before
he
was
exactly
under
it,
and
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
bright
colors
of
the
pictures
which
represented
the
well-known
group
of
the
Virgin
and
the
infant
Jesus.
"That
is
probably
a
wax-work
show,"
thought
he;
"and
the
people
delay
taking
down
their
sign
in
hopes
of
a
late
visitor
or
two."
A
few
persons
in
the
costume
of
the
time
of
King
Hans
passed
quickly
by
him.
"How
strange
they
look!
The
good
folks
come
probably
from
a
masquerade!"
Suddenly
was
heard
the
sound
of
drums
and
fifes;
the
bright
blaze
of
a
fire
shot
up
from
time
to
time,
and
its
ruddy
gleams
seemed
to
contend
with
the
bluish
light
of
the
torches.
The
Councillor
stood
still,
and
watched
a
most
strange
procession
pass
by.
First
came
a
dozen
drummers,
who
understood
pretty
well
how
to
handle
their
instruments;
then
came
halberdiers,
and
some
armed
with
cross-bows.
The
principal
person
in
the
procession
was
a
priest.
Astonished
at
what
he
saw,
the
Councillor
asked
what
was
the
meaning
of
all
this
mummery,
and
who
that
man
was.
"That's
the
Bishop
of
Zealand,"
was
the
answer.
"Good
Heavens!
What
has
taken
possession
of
the
Bishop?"
sighed
the
Councillor,
shaking
his
head.
It
certainly
could
not
be
the
Bishop;
even
though
he
was
considered
the
most
absent
man
in
the
whole
kingdom,
and
people
told
the
drollest
anecdotes
about
him.
Reflecting
on
the
matter,
and
without
looking
right
or
left,
the
Councillor
went
through
East
Street
and
across
the
Habro-Platz.
The
bridge
leading
to
Palace
Square
was
not
to
be
found;
scarcely
trusting
his
senses,
the
nocturnal
wanderer
discovered
a
shallow
piece
of
water,
and
here
fell
in
with
two
men
who
very
comfortably
were
rocking
to
and
fro
in
a
boat.
"Does
your
honor
want
to
cross
the
ferry
to
the
Holme?"
asked
they.
"Across
to
the
Holme!"
said
the
Councillor,
who
knew
nothing
of
the
age
in
which
he
at
that
moment
was.
"No,
I
am
going
to
Christianshafen,
to
Little
Market
Street."
Both
men
stared
at
him
in
astonishment.
"Only
just
tell
me
where
the
bridge
is,"
said
he.
"It
is
really
unpardonable
that
there
are
no
lamps
here;
and
it
is
as
dirty
as
if
one
had
to
wade
through
a
morass."
The
longer
he
spoke
with
the
boatmen,
the
more
unintelligible
did
their
language
become
to
him.
"I
don't
understand
your
Bornholmish
dialect,"
said
he
at
last,
angrily,
and
turning
his
back
upon
them.
He
was
unable
to
find
the
bridge:
there
was
no
railway
either.
"It
is
really
disgraceful
what
a
state
this
place
is
in,"
muttered
he
to
himself.
Never
had
his
age,
with
which,
however,
he
was
always
grumbling,
seemed
so
miserable
as
on
this
evening.
"I'll
take
a
hackney-coach!"
thought
he.
But
where
were
the
hackney-coaches?
Not
one
was
to
be
seen.
"I
must
go
back
to
the
New
Market;
there,
it
is
to
be
hoped,
I
shall
find
some
coaches;
for
if
I
don't,
I
shall
never
get
safe
to
Christianshafen."
So
off
he
went
in
the
direction
of
East
Street,
and
had
nearly
got
to
the
end
of
it
when
the
moon
shone
forth.
"God
bless
me!
What
wooden
scaffolding
is
that
which
they
have
set
up
there?"
cried
he
involuntarily,
as
he
looked
at
East
Gate,
which,
in
those
days,
was
at
the
end
of
East
Street.
He
found,
however,
a
little
side-door
open,
and
through
this
he
went,
and
stepped
into
our
New
Market
of
the
present
time.
It
was
a
huge
desolate
plain;
some
wild
bushes
stood
up
here
and
there,
while
across
the
field
flowed
a
broad
canal
or
river.
Some
wretched
hovels
for
the
Dutch
sailors,
resembling
great
boxes,
and
after
which
the
place
was
named,
lay
about
in
confused
disorder
on
the
opposite
bank.
"I
either
behold
a
fata
morgana,
or
I
am
regularly
tipsy,"
whimpered
out
the
Councillor.
"But
what's
this?"
He
turned
round
anew,
firmly
convinced
that
he
was
seriously
ill.
He
gazed
at
the
street
formerly
so
well
known
to
him,
and
now
so
strange
in
appearance,
and
looked
at
the
houses
more
attentively:
most
of
them
were
of
wood,
slightly
put
together;
and
many
had
a
thatched
roof.
"No--I
am
far
from
well,"
sighed
he;
"and
yet
I
drank
only
one
glass
of
punch;
but
I
cannot
suppose
it--it
was,
too,
really
very
wrong
to
give
us
punch
and
hot
salmon
for
supper.
I
shall
speak
about
it
at
the
first
opportunity.
I
have
half
a
mind
to
go
back
again,
and
say
what
I
suffer.
But
no,
that
would
be
too
silly;
and
Heaven
only
knows
if
they
are
up
still."
He
looked
for
the
house,
but
it
had
vanished.
"It
is
really
dreadful,"
groaned
he
with
increasing
anxiety;
"I
cannot
recognise
East
Street
again;
there
is
not
a
single
decent
shop
from
one
end
to
the
other!
Nothing
but
wretched
huts
can
I
see
anywhere;
just
as
if
I
were
at
Ringstead.
Oh!
I
am
ill!
I
can
scarcely
bear
myself
any
longer.
Where
the
deuce
can
the
house
be?
It
must
be
here
on
this
very
spot;
yet
there
is
not
the
slightest
idea
of
resemblance,
to
such
a
degree
has
everything
changed
this
night!
At
all
events
here
are
some
people
up
and
stirring.
Oh!
oh!
I
am
certainly
very
ill."
He
now
hit
upon
a
half-open
door,
through
a
chink
of
which
a
faint
light
shone.
It
was
a
sort
of
hostelry
of
those
times;
a
kind
of
public-house.
The
room
had
some
resemblance
to
the
clay-floored
halls
in
Holstein;
a
pretty
numerous
company,
consisting
of
seamen,
Copenhagen
burghers,
and
a
few
scholars,
sat
here
in
deep
converse
over
their
pewter
cans,
and
gave
little
heed
to
the
person
who
entered.
"By
your
leave!"
said
the
Councillor
to
the
Hostess,
who
came
bustling
towards
him.
"I've
felt
so
queer
all
of
a
sudden;
would
you
have
the
goodness
to
send
for
a
hackney-coach
to
take
me
to
Christianshafen?"
The
woman
examined
him
with
eyes
of
astonishment,
and
shook
her
head;
she
then
addressed
him
in
German.
The
Councillor
thought
she
did
not
understand
Danish,
and
therefore
repeated
his
wish
in
German.
This,
in
connection
with
his
costume,
strengthened
the
good
woman
in
the
belief
that
he
was
a
foreigner.
That
he
was
ill,
she
comprehended
directly;
so
she
brought
him
a
pitcher
of
water,
which
tasted
certainly
pretty
strong
of
the
sea,
although
it
had
been
fetched
from
the
well.
The
Councillor
supported
his
head
on
his
hand,
drew
a
long
breath,
and
thought
over
all
the
wondrous
things
he
saw
around
him.
"Is
this
the
Daily
News
of
this
evening?"
he
asked
mechanically,
as
he
saw
the
Hostess
push
aside
a
large
sheet
of
paper.
The
meaning
of
this
councillorship
query
remained,
of
course,
a
riddle
to
her,
yet
she
handed
him
the
paper
without
replying.
It
was
a
coarse
wood-cut,
representing
a
splendid
meteor
"as
seen
in
the
town
of
Cologne,"
which
was
to
be
read
below
in
bright
letters.
"That
is
very
old!"
said
the
Councillor,
whom
this
piece
of
antiquity
began
to
make
considerably
more
cheerful.
"Pray
how
did
you
come
into
possession
of
this
rare
print?
It
is
extremely
interesting,
although
the
whole
is
a
mere
fable.
Such
meteorous
appearances
are
to
be
explained
in
this
way--that
they
are
the
reflections
of
the
Aurora
Borealis,
and
it
is
highly
probable
they
are
caused
principally
by
electricity."
Those
persons
who
were
sitting
nearest
him
and
heard
his
speech,
stared
at
him
in
wonderment;
and
one
of
them
rose,
took
off
his
hat
respectfully,
and
said
with
a
serious
countenance,
"You
are
no
doubt
a
very
learned
man,
Monsieur."
"Oh
no,"
answered
the
Councillor,
"I
can
only
join
in
conversation
on
this
topic
and
on
that,
as
indeed
one
must
do
according
to
the
demands
of
the
world
at
present."
"Modestia
is
a
fine
virtue,"
continued
the
gentleman;
"however,
as
to
your
speech,
I
must
say
mihi
secus
videtur:
yet
I
am
willing
to
suspend
my
judicium."
"May
I
ask
with
whom
I
have
the
pleasure
of
speaking?"
asked
the
Councillor.
"I
am
a
Bachelor
in
Theologia,"
answered
the
gentleman
with
a
stiff
reverence.
This
reply
fully
satisfied
the
Councillor;
the
title
suited
the
dress.
"He
is
certainly,"
thought
he,
"some
village
schoolmaster--some
queer
old
fellow,
such
as
one
still
often
meets
with
in
Jutland."
"This
is
no
locus
docendi,
it
is
true,"
began
the
clerical
gentleman;
"yet
I
beg
you
earnestly
to
let
us
profit
by
your
learning.
Your
reading
in
the
ancients
is,
sine
dubio,
of
vast
extent?"
"Oh
yes,
I've
read
something,
to
be
sure,"
replied
the
Councillor.
"I
like
reading
all
useful
works;
but
I
do
not
on
that
account
despise
the
modern
ones;
'tis
only
the
unfortunate
'Tales
of
Every-day
Life'
that
I
cannot
bear--we
have
enough
and
more
than
enough
such
in
reality."
"'Tales
of
Every-day
Life?'"
said
our
Bachelor
inquiringly.
"I
mean
those
new
fangled
novels,
twisting
and
writhing
themselves
in
the
dust
of
commonplace,
which
also
expect
to
find
a
reading
public."
"Oh,"
exclaimed
the
clerical
gentleman
smiling,
"there
is
much
wit
in
them;
besides
they
are
read
at
court.
The
King
likes
the
history
of
Sir
Iffven
and
Sir
Gaudian
particularly,
which
treats
of
King
Arthur,
and
his
Knights
of
the
Round
Table;
he
has
more
than
once
joked
about
it
with
his
high
vassals."
"I
have
not
read
that
novel,"
said
the
Councillor;
"it
must
be
quite
a
new
one,
that
Heiberg
has
published
lately."
"No,"
answered
the
theologian
of
the
time
of
King
Hans:
"that
book
is
not
written
by
a
Heiberg,
but
was
imprinted
by
Godfrey
von
Gehmen."
"Oh,
is
that
the
author's
name?"
said
the
Councillor.
"It
is
a
very
old
name,
and,
as
well
as
I
recollect,
he
was
the
first
printer
that
appeared
in
Denmark."
"Yes,
he
is
our
first
printer,"
replied
the
clerical
gentleman
hastily.
So
far
all
went
on
well.
Some
one
of
the
worthy
burghers
now
spoke
of
the
dreadful
pestilence
that
had
raged
in
the
country
a
few
years
back,
meaning
that
of
1484.
The
Councillor
imagined
it
was
the
cholera
that
was
meant,
which
people
made
so
much
fuss
about;
and
the
discourse
passed
off
satisfactorily
enough.
The
war
of
the
buccaneers
of
1490
was
so
recent
that
it
could
not
fail
being
alluded
to;
the
English
pirates
had,
they
said,
most
shamefully
taken
their
ships
while
in
the
roadstead;
and
the
Councillor,
before
whose
eyes
the
Herostratic
[*
Herostratus,
or
Eratostratus--an
Ephesian,
who
wantonly
set
fire
to
the
famous
temple
of
Diana,
in
order
to
commemorate
his
name
by
so
uncommon
an
action.
]
event
of
1801
still
floated
vividly,
agreed
entirely
with
the
others
in
abusing
the
rascally
English.
With
other
topics
he
was
not
so
fortunate;
every
moment
brought
about
some
new
confusion,
and
threatened
to
become
a
perfect
Babel;
for
the
worthy
Bachelor
was
really
too
ignorant,
and
the
simplest
observations
of
the
Councillor
sounded
to
him
too
daring
and
phantastical.
They
looked
at
one
another
from
the
crown
of
the
head
to
the
soles
of
the
feet;
and
when
matters
grew
to
too
high
a
pitch,
then
the
Bachelor
talked
Latin,
in
the
hope
of
being
better
understood--but
it
was
of
no
use
after
all.
"What's
the
matter?"
asked
the
Hostess,
plucking
the
Councillor
by
the
sleeve;
and
now
his
recollection
returned,
for
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
he
had
entirely
forgotten
all
that
had
preceded
it.
"Merciful
God,
where
am
I!"
exclaimed
he
in
agony;
and
while
he
so
thought,
all
his
ideas
and
feelings
of
overpowering
dizziness,
against
which
he
struggled
with
the
utmost
power
of
desperation,
encompassed
him
with
renewed
force.
"Let
us
drink
claret
and
mead,
and
Bremen
beer,"
shouted
one
of
the
guests--"and
you
shall
drink
with
us!"
Two
maidens
approached.
One
wore
a
cap
of
two
staring
colors,
denoting
the
class
of
persons
to
which
she
belonged.
They
poured
out
the
liquor,
and
made
the
most
friendly
gesticulations;
while
a
cold
perspiration
trickled
down
the
back
of
the
poor
Councillor.
"What's
to
be
the
end
of
this!
What's
to
become
of
me!"
groaned
he;
but
he
was
forced,
in
spite
of
his
opposition,
to
drink
with
the
rest.
They
took
hold
of
the
worthy
man;
who,
hearing
on
every
side
that
he
was
intoxicated,
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
the
truth
of
this
certainly
not
very
polite
assertion;
but
on
the
contrary,
implored
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
present
to
procure
him
a
hackney-coach:
they,
however,
imagined
he
was
talking
Russian.
Never
before,
he
thought,
had
he
been
in
such
a
coarse
and
ignorant
company;
one
might
almost
fancy
the
people
had
turned
heathens
again.
"It
is
the
most
dreadful
moment
of
my
life:
the
whole
world
is
leagued
against
me!"
But
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
stoop
down
under
the
table,
and
then
creep
unobserved
out
of
the
door.
He
did
so;
but
just
as
he
was
going,
the
others
remarked
what
he
was
about;
they
laid
hold
of
him
by
the
legs;
and
now,
happily
for
him,
off
fell
his
fatal
shoes--and
with
them
the
charm
was
at
an
end.
The
Councillor
saw
quite
distinctly
before
him
a
lantern
burning,
and
behind
this
a
large
handsome
house.
All
seemed
to
him
in
proper
order
as
usual;
it
was
East
Street,
splendid
and
elegant
as
we
now
see
it.
He
lay
with
his
feet
towards
a
doorway,
and
exactly
opposite
sat
the
watchman
asleep.
"Gracious
Heaven!"
said
he.
"Have
I
lain
here
in
the
street
and
dreamed?
Yes;
'tis
East
Street!
How
splendid
and
light
it
is!
But
really
it
is
terrible
what
an
effect
that
one
glass
of
punch
must
have
had
on
me!"
Two
minutes
later,
he
was
sitting
in
a
hackney-coach
and
driving
to
Frederickshafen.
He
thought
of
the
distress
and
agony
he
had
endured,
and
praised
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
heart
the
happy
reality--our
own
