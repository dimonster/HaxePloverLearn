The
Lapland
Woman
and
the
Finland
Woman
Suddenly
they
stopped
before
a
little
house,
which
looked
very
miserable.
The
roof
reached
to
the
ground;
and
the
door
was
so
low,
that
the
family
were
obliged
to
creep
upon
their
stomachs
when
they
went
in
or
out.
Nobody
was
at
home
except
an
old
Lapland
woman,
who
was
dressing
fish
by
the
light
of
an
oil
lamp.
And
the
Reindeer
told
her
the
whole
of
Gerda's
history,
but
first
of
all
his
own;
for
that
seemed
to
him
of
much
greater
importance.
Gerda
was
so
chilled
that
she
could
not
speak.
"Poor
thing,"
said
the
Lapland
woman,
"you
have
far
to
run
still.
You
have
more
than
a
hundred
miles
to
go
before
you
get
to
Finland;
there
the
Snow
Queen
has
her
country-house,
and
burns
blue
lights
every
evening.
I
will
give
you
a
few
words
from
me,
which
I
will
write
on
a
dried
haberdine,
for
paper
I
have
none;
this
you
can
take
with
you
to
the
Finland
woman,
and
she
will
be
able
to
give
you
more
information
than
I
can."
When
Gerda
had
warmed
herself,
and
had
eaten
and
drunk,
the
Lapland
woman
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
dried
haberdine,
begged
Gerda
to
take
care
of
them,
put
her
on
the
Reindeer,
bound
her
fast,
and
away
sprang
the
animal.
"Ddsa!
Ddsa!"
was
again
heard
in
the
air;
the
most
charming
blue
lights
burned
the
whole
night
in
the
sky,
and
at
last
they
came
to
Finland.
They
knocked
at
the
chimney
of
the
Finland
woman;
for
as
to
a
door,
she
had
none.
There
was
such
a
heat
inside
that
the
Finland
woman
herself
went
about
almost
naked.
She
was
diminutive
and
dirty.
She
immediately
loosened
little
Gerda's
clothes,
pulled
off
her
thick
gloves
and
boots;
for
otherwise
the
heat
would
have
been
too
great--and
after
laying
a
piece
of
ice
on
the
Reindeer's
head,
read
what
was
written
on
the
fish-skin.
She
read
it
three
times:
she
then
knew
it
by
heart;
so
she
put
the
fish
into
the
cupboard--for
it
might
very
well
be
eaten,
and
she
never
threw
anything
away.
Then
the
Reindeer
related
his
own
story
first,
and
afterwards
that
of
little
Gerda;
and
the
Finland
woman
winked
her
eyes,
but
said
nothing.
"You
are
so
clever,"
said
the
Reindeer;
"you
can,
I
know,
twist
all
the
winds
of
the
world
together
in
a
knot.
If
the
seaman
loosens
one
knot,
then
he
has
a
good
wind;
if
a
second,
then
it
blows
pretty
stiffly;
if
he
undoes
the
third
and
fourth,
then
it
rages
so
that
the
forests
are
upturned.
Will
you
give
the
little
maiden
a
potion,
that
she
may
possess
the
strength
of
twelve
men,
and
vanquish
the
Snow
Queen?"
"The
strength
of
twelve
men!"
said
the
Finland
woman.
"Much
good
that
would
be!"
Then
she
went
to
a
cupboard,
and
drew
out
a
large
skin
rolled
up.
When
she
had
unrolled
it,
strange
characters
were
to
be
seen
written
thereon;
and
the
Finland
woman
read
at
such
a
rate
that
the
perspiration
trickled
down
her
forehead.
But
the
Reindeer
begged
so
hard
for
little
Gerda,
and
Gerda
looked
so
imploringly
with
tearful
eyes
at
the
Finland
woman,
that
she
winked,
and
drew
the
Reindeer
aside
into
a
corner,
where
they
whispered
together,
while
the
animal
got
some
fresh
ice
put
on
his
head.
"'Tis
true
little
Kay
is
at
the
Snow
Queen's,
and
finds
everything
there
quite
to
his
taste;
and
he
thinks
it
the
very
best
place
in
the
world;
but
the
reason
of
that
is,
he
has
a
splinter
of
glass
in
his
eye,
and
in
his
heart.
These
must
be
got
out
first;
otherwise
he
will
never
go
back
to
mankind,
and
the
Snow
Queen
will
retain
her
power
over
him."
"But
can
you
give
little
Gerda
nothing
to
take
which
will
endue
her
with
power
over
the
whole?"
"I
can
give
her
no
more
power
than
what
she
has
already.
Don't
you
see
how
great
it
is?
Don't
you
see
how
men
and
animals
are
forced
to
serve
her;
how
well
she
gets
through
the
world
barefooted?
She
must
not
hear
of
her
power
from
us;
that
power
lies
in
her
heart,
because
she
is
a
sweet
and
innocent
child!
If
she
cannot
get
to
the
Snow
Queen
by
herself,
and
rid
little
Kay
of
the
glass,
we
cannot
help
her.
Two
miles
hence
the
garden
of
the
Snow
Queen
begins;
thither
you
may
carry
the
little
girl.
Set
her
down
by
the
large
bush
with
red
berries,
standing
in
the
snow;
don't
stay
talking,
but
hasten
back
as
fast
as
possible."
And
now
the
Finland
woman
placed
little
Gerda
on
the
Reindeer's
back,
and
off
he
ran
with
all
imaginable
speed.
"Oh!
I
have
not
got
my
boots!
I
have
not
brought
my
gloves!"
cried
little
Gerda.
She
remarked
she
was
without
them
from
the
cutting
frost;
but
the
Reindeer
dared
not
stand
still;
on
he
ran
till
he
came
to
the
great
bush
with
the
red
berries,
and
there
he
set
Gerda
down,
kissed
her
mouth,
while
large
bright
tears
flowed
from
the
animal's
eyes,
and
then
back
he
went
as
fast
as
possible.
There
stood
poor
Gerda
now,
without
shoes
or
gloves,
in
the
very
middle
of
dreadful
icy
Finland.
She
ran
on
as
fast
as
she
could.
There
then
came
a
whole
regiment
of
snow-flakes,
but
they
did
not
fall
from
above,
and
they
were
quite
bright
and
shining
from
the
Aurora
Borealis.
The
flakes
ran
along
the
ground,
and
the
nearer
they
came
the
larger
they
grew.
Gerda
well
remembered
how
large
and
strange
the
snow-flakes
appeared
when
she
once
saw
them
through
a
magnifying-glass;
but
now
they
were
large
and
terrific
in
another
manner--they
were
all
alive.
They
were
the
outposts
of
the
Snow
Queen.
They
had
the
most
wondrous
shapes;
some
looked
like
large
ugly
porcupines;
others
like
snakes
knotted
together,
with
their
heads
sticking
out;
and
others,
again,
like
small
fat
bears,
with
the
hair
standing
on
end:
all
were
of
dazzling
whiteness--all
were
living
snow-flakes.
Little
Gerda
repeated
the
Lord's
Prayer.
The
cold
was
so
intense
that
she
could
see
her
own
breath,
which
came
like
smoke
out
of
her
mouth.
It
grew
thicker
and
thicker,
and
took
the
form
of
little
angels,
that
grew
more
and
more
when
they
touched
the
earth.
All
had
helms
on
their
heads,
and
lances
and
shields
in
their
hands;
they
increased
in
numbers;
and
when
Gerda
had
finished
the
Lord's
Prayer,
she
was
surrounded
by
a
whole
legion.
They
thrust
at
the
horrid
snow-flakes
with
their
spears,
so
that
they
flew
into
a
thousand
pieces;
and
little
Gerda
walked
on
bravely
and
in
security.
The
angels
patted
her
hands
and
feet;
and
then
she
felt
the
cold
less,
and
went
on
quickly
towards
the
palace
of
the
Snow
Queen.
But
now
we
shall
see
how
Kay
fared.
He
never
thought
of
Gerda,
and
least
of
all
that
she
was
standing
before
the
palace.
