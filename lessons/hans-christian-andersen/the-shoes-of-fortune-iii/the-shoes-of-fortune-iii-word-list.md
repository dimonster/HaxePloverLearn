The
Watchman's
Adventure
"Why,
there
is
a
pair
of
galoshes,
as
sure
as
I'm
alive!"
said
the
watchman,
awaking
from
a
gentle
slumber.
"They
belong
no
doubt
to
the
lieutenant
who
lives
over
the
way.
They
lie
close
to
the
door."
The
worthy
man
was
inclined
to
ring
and
deliver
them
at
the
house,
for
there
was
still
a
light
in
the
window;
but
he
did
not
like
disturbing
the
other
people
in
their
beds,
and
so
very
considerately
he
left
the
matter
alone.
"Such
a
pair
of
shoes
must
be
very
warm
and
comfortable,"
said
he;
"the
leather
is
so
soft
and
supple."
They
fitted
his
feet
as
though
they
had
been
made
for
him.
"'Tis
a
curious
world
we
live
in,"
continued
he,
soliloquizing.
"There
is
the
lieutenant,
now,
who
might
go
quietly
to
bed
if
he
chose,
where
no
doubt
he
could
stretch
himself
at
his
ease;
but
does
he
do
it?
No;
he
saunters
up
and
down
his
room,
because,
probably,
he
has
enjoyed
too
many
of
the
good
things
of
this
world
at
his
dinner.
That's
a
happy
fellow!
He
has
neither
an
infirm
mother,
nor
a
whole
troop
of
everlastingly
hungry
children
to
torment
him.
Every
evening
he
goes
to
a
party,
where
his
nice
supper
costs
him
nothing:
would
to
Heaven
I
could
but
change
with
him!
How
happy
should
I
be!"
While
expressing
his
wish,
the
charm
of
the
shoes,
which
he
had
put
on,
began
to
work;
the
watchman
entered
into
the
being
and
nature
of
the
lieutenant.
He
stood
in
the
handsomely
furnished
apartment,
and
held
between
his
fingers
a
small
sheet
of
rose-colored
paper,
on
which
some
verses
were
written--written
indeed
by
the
officer
himself;
for
who
has
not,
at
least
once
in
his
life,
had
a
lyrical
moment?
And
if
one
then
marks
down
one's
thoughts,
poetry
is
produced.
But
here
was
written:
OH,
WERE
I
RICH!
"Oh,
were
I
rich!
Such
was
my
wish,
yea
such
When
hardly
three
feet
high,
I
longed
for
much.
Oh,
were
I
rich!
an
officer
were
I,
With
sword,
and
uniform,
and
plume
so
high.
And
the
time
came,
and
officer
was
I!
But
yet
I
grew
not
rich.
Alas,
poor
me!
Have
pity,
Thou,
who
all
man's
wants
dost
see.
"I
sat
one
evening
sunk
in
dreams
of
bliss,
A
maid
of
seven
years
old
gave
me
a
kiss,
I
at
that
time
was
rich
in
poesy
And
tales
of
old,
though
poor
as
poor
could
be;
But
all
she
asked
for
was
this
poesy.
Then
was
I
rich,
but
not
in
gold,
poor
me!
As
Thou
dost
know,
who
all
men's
hearts
canst
see.
"Oh,
were
I
rich!
Oft
asked
I
for
this
boon.
The
child
grew
up
to
womanhood
full
soon.
She
is
so
pretty,
clever,
and
so
kind
Oh,
did
she
know
what's
hidden
in
my
mind--
A
tale
of
old.
Would
she
to
me
were
kind!
But
I'm
condemned
to
silence!
oh,
poor
me!
As
Thou
dost
know,
who
all
men's
hearts
canst
see.
"Oh,
were
I
rich
in
calm
and
peace
of
mind,
My
grief
you
then
would
not
here
written
find!
O
thou,
to
whom
I
do
my
heart
devote,
Oh
read
this
page
of
glad
days
now
remote,
A
dark,
dark
tale,
which
I
tonight
devote!
Dark
is
the
future
now.
Alas,
poor
me!
Have
pity
Thou,
who
all
men's
pains
dost
see."
Such
verses
as
these
people
write
when
they
are
in
love!
But
no
man
in
his
senses
ever
thinks
of
printing
them.
Here
one
of
the
sorrows
of
life,
in
which
there
is
real
poetry,
gave
itself
vent;
not
that
barren
grief
which
the
poet
may
only
hint
at,
but
never
depict
in
its
detail--misery
and
want:
that
animal
necessity,
in
short,
to
snatch
at
least
at
a
fallen
leaf
of
the
bread-fruit
tree,
if
not
at
the
fruit
itself.
The
higher
the
position
in
which
one
finds
oneself
transplanted,
the
greater
is
the
suffering.
Everyday
necessity
is
the
stagnant
pool
of
life--no
lovely
picture
reflects
itself
therein.
Lieutenant,
love,
and
lack
of
money--that
is
a
symbolic
triangle,
or
much
the
same
as
the
half
of
the
shattered
die
of
Fortune.
This
the
lieutenant
felt
most
poignantly,
and
this
was
the
reason
he
leant
his
head
against
the
window,
and
sighed
so
deeply.
"The
poor
watchman
out
there
in
the
street
is
far
happier
than
I.
He
knows
not
what
I
term
privation.
He
has
a
home,
a
wife,
and
children,
who
weep
with
him
over
his
sorrows,
who
rejoice
with
him
when
he
is
glad.
Oh,
far
happier
were
I,
could
I
exchange
with
him
my
being--with
his
desires
and
with
his
hopes
perform
the
weary
pilgrimage
of
life!
Oh,
he
is
a
hundred
times
happier
than
I!"
In
the
same
moment
the
watchman
was
again
watchman.
It
was
the
shoes
that
caused
the
metamorphosis
by
means
of
which,
unknown
to
himself,
he
took
upon
him
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
the
officer;
but,
as
we
have
just
seen,
he
felt
himself
in
his
new
situation
much
less
contented,
and
now
preferred
the
very
thing
which
but
some
minutes
before
he
had
rejected.
So
then
the
watchman
was
again
watchman.
"That
was
an
unpleasant
dream,"
said
he;
"but
'twas
droll
enough
altogether.
I
fancied
that
I
was
the
lieutenant
over
there:
and
yet
the
thing
was
not
very
much
to
my
taste
after
all.
I
missed
my
good
old
mother
and
the
dear
little
ones;
who
almost
tear
me
to
pieces
for
sheer
love."
He
seated
himself
once
more
and
nodded:
the
dream
continued
to
haunt
him,
for
he
still
had
the
shoes
on
his
feet.
A
falling
star
shone
in
the
dark
firmament.
"There
falls
another
star,"
said
he:
"but
what
does
it
matter;
there
are
always
enough
left.
I
should
not
much
mind
examining
the
little
glimmering
things
somewhat
nearer,
especially
the
moon;
for
that
would
not
slip
so
easily
through
a
man's
fingers.
When
we
die--so
at
least
says
the
student,
for
whom
my
wife
does
the
washing--we
shall
fly
about
as
light
as
a
feather
from
one
such
a
star
to
the
other.
That's,
of
course,
not
true:
but
'twould
be
pretty
enough
if
it
were
so.
If
I
could
but
once
take
a
leap
up
there,
my
body
might
stay
here
on
the
steps
for
what
I
care."
Behold--there
are
certain
things
in
the
world
to
which
one
ought
never
to
give
utterance
except
with
the
greatest
caution;
but
doubly
careful
must
one
be
when
we
have
the
Shoes
of
Fortune
on
our
feet.
Now
just
listen
to
what
happened
to
the
watchman.
As
to
ourselves,
we
all
know
the
speed
produced
by
the
employment
of
steam;
we
have
experienced
it
either
on
railroads,
or
in
boats
when
crossing
the
sea;
but
such
a
flight
is
like
the
travelling
of
a
sloth
in
comparison
with
the
velocity
with
which
light
moves.
It
flies
nineteen
million
times
faster
than
the
best
race-horse;
and
yet
electricity
is
quicker
still.
Death
is
an
electric
shock
which
our
heart
receives;
the
freed
soul
soars
upwards
on
the
wings
of
electricity.
The
sun's
light
wants
eight
minutes
and
some
seconds
to
perform
a
journey
of
more
than
twenty
million
of
our
Danish
[*
A
Danish
mile
is
nearly
4
3/4
English.
]
miles;
borne
by
electricity,
the
soul
wants
even
some
minutes
less
to
accomplish
the
same
flight.
To
it
the
space
between
the
heavenly
bodies
is
not
greater
than
the
distance
between
the
homes
of
our
friends
in
town
is
for
us,
even
if
they
live
a
short
way
from
each
other;
such
an
electric
shock
in
the
heart,
however,
costs
us
the
use
of
the
body
here
below;
unless,
like
the
watchman
of
East
Street,
we
happen
to
have
on
the
Shoes
of
Fortune.
In
a
few
seconds
the
watchman
had
done
the
fifty-two
thousand
of
our
miles
up
to
the
moon,
which,
as
everyone
knows,
was
formed
out
of
matter
much
lighter
than
our
earth;
and
is,
so
we
should
say,
as
soft
as
newly-fallen
snow.
He
found
himself
on
one
of
the
many
circumjacent
mountain-ridges
with
which
we
are
acquainted
by
means
of
Dr.
Madler's
"Map
of
the
Moon."
Within,
down
it
sunk
perpendicularly
into
a
caldron,
about
a
Danish
mile
in
depth;
while
below
lay
a
town,
whose
appearance
we
can,
in
some
measure,
realize
to
ourselves
by
beating
the
white
of
an
egg
in
a
glass
of
water.
The
matter
of
which
it
was
built
was
just
as
soft,
and
formed
similar
towers,
and
domes,
and
pillars,
transparent
and
rocking
in
the
thin
air;
while
above
his
head
our
earth
was
rolling
like
a
large
fiery
ball.
He
perceived
immediately
a
quantity
of
beings
who
were
certainly
what
we
call
"men";
yet
they
looked
different
to
us.
A
far
more
correct
imagination
than
that
of
the
pseudo-Herschel
had
created
them;
and
if
they
had
been
placed
in
rank
and
file,
and
copied
by
some
skilful
painter's
hand,
one
would,
without
doubt,
have
exclaimed
involuntarily,
"What
a
beautiful
arabesque!"
They
had
a
language
too;
but
surely
nobody
can
expect
that
the
soul
of
the
watchman
should
understand
it.
Be
that
as
it
may,
it
did
comprehend
it;
for
in
our
souls
there
germinate
far
greater
powers
than
we
poor
mortals,
despite
all
our
cleverness,
have
any
notion
of.
Does
she
not
show
us--she
the
queen
in
the
land
of
enchantment--her
astounding
dramatic
talent
in
all
our
dreams?
There
every
acquaintance
appears
and
speaks
upon
the
stage,
so
entirely
in
character,
and
with
the
same
tone
of
voice,
that
none
of
us,
when
awake,
were
able
to
imitate
it.
How
well
can
she
recall
persons
to
our
mind,
of
whom
we
have
not
thought
for
years;
when
suddenly
they
step
forth
"every
inch
a
man,"
resembling
the
real
personages,
even
to
the
finest
features,
and
become
the
heroes
or
heroines
of
our
world
of
dreams.
In
reality,
such
remembrances
are
rather
unpleasant:
every
sin,
every
evil
thought,
may,
like
a
clock
with
alarm
or
chimes,
be
repeated
at
pleasure;
then
the
question
is
if
we
can
trust
ourselves
to
give
an
account
of
every
unbecoming
word
in
our
heart
and
on
our
lips.
The
watchman's
spirit
understood
the
language
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
pretty
well.
The
Selenites
disputed
variously
about
our
earth,
and
expressed
their
doubts
if
it
could
be
inhabited:
the
air,
they
said,
must
certainly
be
too
dense
to
allow
any
rational
dweller
in
the
moon
the
necessary
free
respiration.
They
considered
the
moon
alone
to
be
inhabited:
they
imagined
it
was
the
real
heart
of
the
universe
or
planetary
system,
on
which
the
genuine
Cosmopolites,
or
citizens
of
the
world,
dwelt.
What
strange
things
men--no,
what
strange
things
Selenites
sometimes
take
into
their
heads!
About
politics
they
had
a
good
deal
to
say.
But
little
Denmark
must
take
care
what
it
is
about,
and
not
run
counter
to
the
moon;
that
great
realm,
that
might
in
an
ill-humor
bestir
itself,
and
dash
down
a
hail-storm
in
our
faces,
or
force
the
Baltic
to
overflow
the
sides
of
its
gigantic
basin.
We
will,
therefore,
not
listen
to
what
was
spoken,
and
on
no
condition
run
in
the
possibility
of
telling
tales
out
of
school;
but
we
will
rather
proceed,
like
good
quiet
citizens,
to
East
Street,
and
observe
what
happened
meanwhile
to
the
body
of
the
watchman.
He
sat
lifeless
on
the
steps:
the
morning-star,
that
is
to
say,
the
heavy
wooden
staff,
headed
with
iron
spikes,
and
which
had
nothing
else
in
common
with
its
sparkling
brother
in
the
sky,
had
glided
from
his
hand;
while
his
eyes
were
fixed
with
glassy
stare
on
the
moon,
looking
for
the
good
old
fellow
of
a
spirit
which
still
haunted
it.
"What's
the
hour,
watchman?"
asked
a
passer-by.
But
when
the
watchman
gave
no
reply,
the
merry
roysterer,
who
was
now
returning
home
from
a
noisy
drinking
bout,
took
it
into
his
head
to
try
what
a
tweak
of
the
nose
would
do,
on
which
the
supposed
sleeper
lost
his
balance,
the
body
lay
motionless,
stretched
out
on
the
pavement:
the
man
was
dead.
When
the
patrol
came
up,
all
his
comrades,
who
comprehended
nothing
of
the
whole
affair,
were
seized
with
a
dreadful
fright,
for
dead
he
was,
and
he
remained
so.
The
proper
authorities
were
informed
of
the
circumstance,
people
talked
a
good
deal
about
it,
and
in
the
morning
the
body
was
carried
to
the
hospital.
Now
that
would
be
a
very
pretty
joke,
if
the
spirit
when
it
came
back
and
looked
for
the
body
in
East
Street,
were
not
to
find
one.
No
doubt
it
would,
in
its
anxiety,
run
off
to
the
police,
and
then
to
the
"Hue
and
Cry"
office,
to
announce
that
"the
finder
will
be
handsomely
rewarded,"
and
at
last
away
to
the
hospital;
yet
we
may
boldly
assert
that
the
soul
is
shrewdest
when
it
shakes
off
every
fetter,
and
every
sort
of
leading-string--the
body
only
makes
it
stupid.
The
seemingly
dead
body
of
the
watchman
wandered,
as
we
have
said,
to
the
hospital,
where
it
was
brought
into
the
general
viewing-room:
and
the
first
thing
that
was
done
here
was
naturally
to
pull
off
the
galoshes--when
the
spirit,
that
was
merely
gone
out
on
adventures,
must
have
returned
with
the
quickness
of
lightning
to
its
earthly
tenement.
It
took
its
direction
towards
the
body
in
a
straight
line;
and
a
few
seconds
after,
life
began
to
show
itself
in
the
man.
He
asserted
that
the
preceding
night
had
been
the
worst
that
ever
the
malice
of
fate
had
allotted
him;
he
would
not
for
two
silver
marks
again
go
through
what
he
had
endured
while
moon-stricken;
but
now,
however,
it
was
over.
The
same
day
he
was
discharged
from
the
hospital
as
perfectly
cured;
but
the
Shoes
meanwhile
remained
behind.
