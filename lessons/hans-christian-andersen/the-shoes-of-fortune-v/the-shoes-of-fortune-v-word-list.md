Metamorphosis
of
the
Copying-Clerk
The
watchman,
whom
we
have
certainly
not
forgotten,
thought
meanwhile
of
the
galoshes
he
had
found
and
taken
with
him
to
the
hospital;
he
now
went
to
fetch
them;
and
as
neither
the
lieutenant,
nor
anybody
else
in
the
street,
claimed
them
as
his
property,
they
were
delivered
over
to
the
police-office.*
*As
on
the
continent,
in
all
law
and
police
practices
nothing
is
verbal,
but
any
circumstance,
however
trifling,
is
reduced
to
writing,
the
labor,
as
well
as
the
number
of
papers
that
thus
accumulate,
is
enormous.
In
a
police-office,
consequently,
we
find
copying-clerks
among
many
other
scribes
of
various
denominations,
of
which,
it
seems,
our
hero
was
one.
"Why,
I
declare
the
Shoes
look
just
like
my
own,"
said
one
of
the
clerks,
eying
the
newly-found
treasure,
whose
hidden
powers,
even
he,
sharp
as
he
was,
was
not
able
to
discover.
"One
must
have
more
than
the
eye
of
a
shoemaker
to
know
one
pair
from
the
other,"
said
he,
soliloquizing;
and
putting,
at
the
same
time,
the
galoshes
in
search
of
an
owner,
beside
his
own
in
the
corner.
"Here,
sir!"
said
one
of
the
men,
who
panting
brought
him
a
tremendous
pile
of
papers.
The
copying-clerk
turned
round
and
spoke
awhile
with
the
man
about
the
reports
and
legal
documents
in
question;
but
when
he
had
finished,
and
his
eye
fell
again
on
the
Shoes,
he
was
unable
to
say
whether
those
to
the
left
or
those
to
the
right
belonged
to
him.
"At
all
events
it
must
be
those
which
are
wet,"
thought
he;
but
this
time,
in
spite
of
his
cleverness,
he
guessed
quite
wrong,
for
it
was
just
those
of
Fortune
which
played
as
it
were
into
his
hands,
or
rather
on
his
feet.
And
why,
I
should
like
to
know,
are
the
police
never
to
be
wrong?
So
he
put
them
on
quickly,
stuck
his
papers
in
his
pocket,
and
took
besides
a
few
under
his
arm,
intending
to
look
them
through
at
home
to
make
the
necessary
notes.
It
was
noon;
and
the
weather,
that
had
threatened
rain,
began
to
clear
up,
while
gaily
dressed
holiday
folks
filled
the
streets.
"A
little
trip
to
Fredericksburg
would
do
me
no
great
harm,"
thought
he;
"for
I,
poor
beast
of
burden
that
I
am,
have
so
much
to
annoy
me,
that
I
don't
know
what
a
good
appetite
is.
'Tis
a
bitter
crust,
alas!
at
which
I
am
condemned
to
gnaw!"
Nobody
could
be
more
steady
or
quiet
than
this
young
man;
we
therefore
wish
him
joy
of
the
excursion
with
all
our
heart;
and
it
will
certainly
be
beneficial
for
a
person
who
leads
so
sedentary
a
life.
In
the
park
he
met
a
friend,
one
of
our
young
poets,
who
told
him
that
the
following
day
he
should
set
out
on
his
long-intended
tour.
"So
you
are
going
away
again!"
said
the
clerk.
"You
are
a
very
free
and
happy
being;
we
others
are
chained
by
the
leg
and
held
fast
to
our
desk."
"Yes;
but
it
is
a
chain,
friend,
which
ensures
you
the
blessed
bread
of
existence,"
answered
the
poet.
"You
need
feel
no
care
for
the
coming
morrow:
when
you
are
old,
you
receive
a
pension."
"True,"
said
the
clerk,
shrugging
his
shoulders;
"and
yet
you
are
the
better
off.
To
sit
at
one's
ease
and
poetise--that
is
a
pleasure;
everybody
has
something
agreeable
to
say
to
you,
and
you
are
always
your
own
master.
No,
friend,
you
should
but
try
what
it
is
to
sit
from
one
year's
end
to
the
other
occupied
with
and
judging
the
most
trivial
matters."
The
poet
shook
his
head,
the
copying-clerk
did
the
same.
Each
one
kept
to
his
own
opinion,
and
so
they
separated.
"It's
a
strange
race,
those
poets!"
said
the
clerk,
who
was
very
fond
of
soliloquizing.
"I
should
like
some
day,
just
for
a
trial,
to
take
such
nature
upon
me,
and
be
a
poet
myself;
I
am
very
sure
I
should
make
no
such
miserable
verses
as
the
others.
Today,
methinks,
is
a
most
delicious
day
for
a
poet.
Nature
seems
anew
to
celebrate
her
awakening
into
life.
The
air
is
so
unusually
clear,
the
clouds
sail
on
so
buoyantly,
and
from
the
green
herbage
a
fragrance
is
exhaled
that
fills
me
with
delight.
For
many
a
year
have
I
not
felt
as
at
this
moment."
We
see
already,
by
the
foregoing
effusion,
that
he
is
become
a
poet;
to
give
further
proof
of
it,
however,
would
in
most
cases
be
insipid,
for
it
is
a
most
foolish
notion
to
fancy
a
poet
different
from
other
men.
Among
the
latter
there
may
be
far
more
poetical
natures
than
many
an
acknowledged
poet,
when
examined
more
closely,
could
boast
of;
the
difference
only
is,
that
the
poet
possesses
a
better
mental
memory,
on
which
account
he
is
able
to
retain
the
feeling
and
the
thought
till
they
can
be
embodied
by
means
of
words;
a
faculty
which
the
others
do
not
possess.
But
the
transition
from
a
commonplace
nature
to
one
that
is
richly
endowed,
demands
always
a
more
or
less
breakneck
leap
over
a
certain
abyss
which
yawns
threateningly
below;
and
thus
must
the
sudden
change
with
the
clerk
strike
the
reader.
"The
sweet
air!"
continued
he
of
the
police-office,
in
his
dreamy
imaginings;
"how
it
reminds
me
of
the
violets
in
the
garden
of
my
aunt
Magdalena!
Yes,
then
I
was
a
little
wild
boy,
who
did
not
go
to
school
very
regularly.
O
heavens!
'tis
a
long
time
since
I
have
thought
on
those
times.
The
good
old
soul!
She
lived
behind
the
Exchange.
She
always
had
a
few
twigs
or
green
shoots
in
water--let
the
winter
rage
without
as
it
might.
The
violets
exhaled
their
sweet
breath,
whilst
I
pressed
against
the
windowpanes
covered
with
fantastic
frost-work
the
copper
coin
I
had
heated
on
the
stove,
and
so
made
peep-holes.
What
splendid
vistas
were
then
opened
to
my
view!
What
change--what
magnificence!
Yonder
in
the
canal
lay
the
ships
frozen
up,
and
deserted
by
their
whole
crews,
with
a
screaming
crow
for
the
sole
occupant.
But
when
the
spring,
with
a
gentle
stirring
motion,
announced
her
arrival,
a
new
and
busy
life
arose;
with
songs
and
hurrahs
the
ice
was
sawn
asunder,
the
ships
were
fresh
tarred
and
rigged,
that
they
might
sail
away
to
distant
lands.
But
I
have
remained
here--must
always
remain
here,
sitting
at
my
desk
in
the
office,
and
patiently
see
other
people
fetch
their
passports
to
go
abroad.
Such
is
my
fate!
Alas!"--sighed
he,
and
was
again
silent.
"Great
Heaven!
What
is
come
to
me!
Never
have
I
thought
or
felt
like
this
before!
It
must
be
the
summer
air
that
affects
me
with
feelings
almost
as
disquieting
as
they
are
refreshing."
He
felt
in
his
pocket
for
the
papers.
"These
police-reports
will
soon
stem
the
torrent
of
my
ideas,
and
effectually
hinder
any
rebellious
overflowing
of
the
time-worn
banks
of
official
duties";
he
said
to
himself
consolingly,
while
his
eye
ran
over
the
first
page.
"DAME
TIGBRITH,
tragedy
in
five
acts."
"What
is
that?
And
yet
it
is
undeniably
my
own
handwriting.
Have
I
written
the
tragedy?
Wonderful,
very
wonderful!--And
this--what
have
I
here?
'INTRIGUE
ON
THE
RAMPARTS;
or
THE DAY OF REPENTANCE:
vaudeville
with
new
songs
to
the
most
favorite
airs.'
The
deuce!
Where
did
I
get
all
this
rubbish?
Some
one
must
have
slipped
it
slyly
into
my
pocket
for
a
joke.
There
is
too
a
letter
to
me;
a
crumpled
letter
and
the
seal
broken."
Yes;
it
was
not
a
very
polite
epistle
from
the
manager
of
a
theatre,
in
which
both
pieces
were
flatly
refused.
"Hem!
hem!"
said
the
clerk
breathlessly,
and
quite
exhausted
he
seated
himself
on
a
bank.
His
thoughts
were
so
elastic,
his
heart
so
tender;
and
involuntarily
he
picked
one
of
the
nearest
flowers.
It
is
a
simple
daisy,
just
bursting
out
of
the
bud.
What
the
botanist
tells
us
after
a
number
of
imperfect
lectures,
the
flower
proclaimed
in
a
minute.
It
related
the
mythus
of
its
birth,
told
of
the
power
of
the
sun-light
that
spread
out
its
delicate
leaves,
and
forced
them
to
impregnate
the
air
with
their
incense--and
then
he
thought
of
the
manifold
struggles
of
life,
which
in
like
manner
awaken
the
budding
flowers
of
feeling
in
our
bosom.
Light
and
air
contend
with
chivalric
emulation
for
the
love
of
the
fair
flower
that
bestowed
her
chief
favors
on
the
latter;
full
of
longing
she
turned
towards
the
light,
and
as
soon
as
it
vanished,
rolled
her
tender
leaves
together
and
slept
in
the
embraces
of
the
air.
"It
is
the
light
which
adorns
me,"
said
the
flower.
"But
'tis
the
air
which
enables
thee
to
breathe,"
said
the
poet's
voice.
Close
by
stood
a
boy
who
dashed
his
stick
into
a
wet
ditch.
The
drops
of
water
splashed
up
to
the
green
leafy
roof,
and
the
clerk
thought
of
the
million
of
ephemera
which
in
a
single
drop
were
thrown
up
to
a
height,
that
was
as
great
doubtless
for
their
size,
as
for
us
if
we
were
to
be
hurled
above
the
clouds.
While
he
thought
of
this
and
of
the
whole
metamorphosis
he
had
undergone,
he
smiled
and
said,
"I
sleep
and
dream;
but
it
is
wonderful
how
one
can
dream
so
naturally,
and
know
besides
so
exactly
that
it
is
but
a
dream.
If
only
to-morrow
on
awaking,
I
could
again
call
all
to
mind
so
vividly!
I
seem
in
unusually
good
spirits;
my
perception
of
things
is
clear,
I
feel
as
light
and
cheerful
as
though
I
were
in
heaven;
but
I
know
for
a
certainty,
that
if
to-morrow
a
dim
remembrance
of
it
should
swim
before
my
mind,
it
will
then
seem
nothing
but
stupid
nonsense,
as
I
have
often
experienced
already--especially
before
I
enlisted
under
the
banner
of
the
police,
for
that
dispels
like
a
whirlwind
all
the
visions
of
an
unfettered
imagination.
All
we
hear
or
say
in
a
dream
that
is
fair
and
beautiful
is
like
the
gold
of
the
subterranean
spirits;
it
is
rich
and
splendid
when
it
is
given
us,
but
viewed
by
daylight
we
find
only
withered
leaves.
Alas!"
he
sighed
quite
sorrowful,
and
gazed
at
the
chirping
birds
that
hopped
contentedly
from
branch
to
branch,
"they
are
much
better
off
than
I!
To
fly
must
be
a
heavenly
art;
and
happy
do
I
prize
that
creature
in
which
it
is
innate.
Yes!
Could
I
exchange
my
nature
with
any
other
creature,
I
fain
would
be
such
a
happy
little
lark!"
He
had
hardly
uttered
these
hasty
words
when
the
skirts
and
sleeves
of
his
coat
folded
themselves
together
into
wings;
the
clothes
became
feathers,
and
the
galoshes
claws.
He
observed
it
perfectly,
and
laughed
in
his
heart.
"Now
then,
there
is
no
doubt
that
I
am
dreaming;
but
I
never
before
was
aware
of
such
mad
freaks
as
these."
And
up
he
flew
into
the
green
roof
and
sang;
but
in
the
song
there
was
no
poetry,
for
the
spirit
of
the
poet
was
gone.
The
Shoes,
as
is
the
case
with
anybody
who
does
what
he
has
to
do
properly,
could
only
attend
to
one
thing
at
a
time.
He
wanted
to
be
a
poet,
and
he
was
one;
he
now
wished
to
be
a
merry
chirping
bird:
but
when
he
was
metamorphosed
into
one,
the
former
peculiarities
ceased
immediately.
"It
is
really
pleasant
enough,"
said
he:
"the
whole
day
long
I
sit
in
the
office
amid
the
driest
law-papers,
and
at
night
I
fly
in
my
dream
as
a
lark
in
the
gardens
of
Fredericksburg;
one
might
really
write
a
very
pretty
comedy
upon
it."
He
now
fluttered
down
into
the
grass,
turned
his
head
gracefully
on
every
side,
and
with
his
bill
pecked
the
pliant
blades
of
grass,
which,
in
comparison
to
his
present
size,
seemed
as
majestic
as
the
palm-branches
of
northern
Africa.
Unfortunately
the
pleasure
lasted
but
a
moment.
Presently
black
night
overshadowed
our
enthusiast,
who
had
so
entirely
missed
his
part
of
copying-clerk
at
a
police-office;
some
vast
object
seemed
to
be
thrown
over
him.
It
was
a
large
oil-skin
cap,
which
a
sailor-boy
of
the
quay
had
thrown
over
the
struggling
bird;
a
coarse
hand
sought
its
way
carefully
in
under
the
broad
rim,
and
seized
the
clerk
over
the
back
and
wings.
In
the
first
moment
of
fear,
he
called,
indeed,
as
loud
as
he
could--"You
impudent
little
blackguard!
I
am
a
copying-clerk
at
the
police-office;
and
you
know
you
cannot
insult
any
belonging
to
the
constabulary
force
without
a
chastisement.
Besides,
you
good-for-nothing
rascal,
it
is
strictly
forbidden
to
catch
birds
in
the
royal
gardens
of
Fredericksburg;
but
your
blue
uniform
betrays
where
you
come
from."
This
fine
tirade
sounded,
however,
to
the
ungodly
sailor-boy
like
a
mere
"Pippi-pi."
He
gave
the
noisy
bird
a
knock
on
his
beak,
and
walked
on.
He
was
soon
met
by
two
schoolboys
of
the
upper
class--that
is
to
say
as
individuals,
for
with
regard
to
learning
they
were
in
the
lowest
class
in
the
school;
and
they
bought
the
stupid
bird.
So
the
copying-clerk
came
to
Copenhagen
as
guest,
or
rather
as
prisoner
in
a
family
living
in
Gother
Street.
"'Tis
well
that
I'm
dreaming,"
said
the
clerk,
"or
I
really
should
get
angry.
First
I
was
a
poet;
now
sold
for
a
few
pence
as
a
lark;
no
doubt
it
was
that
accursed
poetical
nature
which
has
metamorphosed
me
into
such
a
poor
harmless
little
creature.
It
is
really
pitiable,
particularly
when
one
gets
into
the
hands
of
a
little
blackguard,
perfect
in
all
sorts
of
cruelty
to
animals:
all
I
should
like
to
know
is,
how
the
story
will
end."
The
two
schoolboys,
the
proprietors
now
of
the
transformed
clerk,
carried
him
into
an
elegant
room.
A
stout
stately
dame
received
them
with
a
smile;
but
she
expressed
much
dissatisfaction
that
a
common
field-bird,
as
she
called
the
lark,
should
appear
in
such
high
society.
For
to-day,
however,
she
would
allow
it;
and
they
must
shut
him
in
the
empty
cage
that
was
standing
in
the
window.
"Perhaps
he
will
amuse
my
good
Polly,"
added
the
lady,
looking
with
a
benignant
smile
at
a
large
green
parrot
that
swung
himself
backwards
and
forwards
most
comfortably
in
his
ring,
inside
a
magnificent
brass-wired
cage.
"To-day
is
Polly's
birthday,"
said
she
with
stupid
simplicity:
"and
the
little
brown
field-bird
must
wish
him
joy."
Mr.
Polly
uttered
not
a
syllable
in
reply,
but
swung
to
and
fro
with
dignified
condescension;
while
a
pretty
canary,
as
yellow
as
gold,
that
had
lately
been
brought
from
his
sunny
fragrant
home,
began
to
sing
aloud.
"Noisy
creature!
Will
you
be
quiet!"
screamed
the
lady
of
the
house,
covering
the
cage
with
an
embroidered
white
pocket
handkerchief.
"Chirp,
chirp!"
sighed
he.
"That
was
a
dreadful
snowstorm";
and
he
sighed
again,
and
was
silent.
The
copying-clerk,
or,
as
the
lady
said,
the
brown
field-bird,
was
put
into
a
small
cage,
close
to
the
Canary,
and
not
far
from
"my
good
Polly."
The
only
human
sounds
that
the
Parrot
could
bawl
out
were,
"Come,
let
us
be
men!"
Everything
else
that
he
said
was
as
unintelligible
to
everybody
as
the
chirping
of
the
Canary,
except
to
the
clerk,
who
was
now
a
bird
too:
he
understood
his
companion
perfectly.
"I
flew
about
beneath
the
green
palms
and
the
blossoming
almond-trees,"
sang
the
Canary;
"I
flew
around,
with
my
brothers
and
sisters,
over
the
beautiful
flowers,
and
over
the
glassy
lakes,
where
the
bright
water-plants
nodded
to
me
from
below.
There,
too,
I
saw
many
splendidly-dressed
paroquets,
that
told
the
drollest
stories,
and
the
wildest
fairy
tales
without
end."
"Oh!
those
were
uncouth
birds,"
answered
the
Parrot.
"They
had
no
education,
and
talked
of
whatever
came
into
their
head.
"If
my
mistress
and
all
her
friends
can
laugh
at
what
I
say,
so
may
you
too,
I
should
think.
It
is
a
great
fault
to
have
no
taste
for
what
is
witty
or
amusing--come,
let
us
be
men."
"Ah,
you
have
no
remembrance
of
love
for
the
charming
maidens
that
danced
beneath
the
outspread
tents
beside
the
bright
fragrant
flowers?
Do
you
no
longer
remember
the
sweet
fruits,
and
the
cooling
juice
in
the
wild
plants
of
our
never-to-be-forgotten
home?"
said
the
former
inhabitant
of
the
Canary
Isles,
continuing
his
dithyrambic.
"Oh,
yes,"
said
the
Parrot;
"but
I
am
far
better
off
here.
I
am
well
fed,
and
get
friendly
treatment.
I
know
I
am
a
clever
fellow;
and
that
is
all
I
care
about.
Come,
let
us
be
men.
You
are
of
a
poetical
nature,
as
it
is
called--I,
on
the
contrary,
possess
profound
knowledge
and
inexhaustible
wit.
You
have
genius;
but
clear-sighted,
calm
discretion
does
not
take
such
lofty
flights,
and
utter
such
high
natural
tones.
For
this
they
have
covered
you
over--they
never
do
the
like
to
me;
for
I
cost
more.
Besides,
they
are
afraid
of
my
beak;
and
I
have
always
a
witty
answer
at
hand.
Come,
let
us
be
men!"
"O
warm
spicy
land
of
my
birth,"
sang
the
Canary
bird;
"I
will
sing
of
thy
dark-green
bowers,
of
the
calm
bays
where
the
pendent
boughs
kiss
the
surface
of
the
water;
I
will
sing
of
the
rejoicing
of
all
my
brothers
and
sisters
where
the
cactus
grows
in
wanton
luxuriance."
"Spare
us
your
elegiac
tones,"
said
the
Parrot
giggling.
"Rather
speak
of
something
at
which
one
may
laugh
heartily.
Laughing
is
an
infallible
sign
of
the
highest
degree
of
mental
development.
Can
a
dog,
or
a
horse
laugh?
No,
but
they
can
cry.
The
gift
of
laughing
was
given
to
man
alone.
Ha!
ha!
ha!"
screamed
Polly,
and
added
his
stereotype
witticism.
"Come,
let
us
be
men!"
"Poor
little
Danish
grey-bird,"
said
the
Canary;
"you
have
been
caught
too.
It
is,
no
doubt,
cold
enough
in
your
woods,
but
there
at
least
is
the
breath
of
liberty;
therefore
fly
away.
In
the
hurry
they
have
forgotten
to
shut
your
cage,
and
the
upper
window
is
open.
Fly,
my
friend;
fly
away.
Farewell!"
Instinctively
the
Clerk
obeyed;
with
a
few
strokes
of
his
wings
he
was
out
of
the
cage;
but
at
the
same
moment
the
door,
which
was
only
ajar,
and
which
led
to
the
next
room,
began
to
creak,
and
supple
and
creeping
came
the
large
tomcat
into
the
room,
and
began
to
pursue
him.
The
frightened
Canary
fluttered
about
in
his
cage;
the
Parrot
flapped
his
wings,
and
cried,
"Come,
let
us
be
men!"
The
Clerk
felt
a
mortal
fright,
and
flew
through
the
window,
far
away
over
the
houses
and
streets.
At
last
he
was
forced
to
rest
a
little.
The
neighboring
house
had
a
something
familiar
about
it;
a
window
stood
open;
he
flew
in;
it
was
his
own
room.
He
perched
upon
the
table.
"Come,
let
us
be
men!"
said
he,
involuntarily
imitating
the
chatter
of
the
Parrot,
and
at
the
same
moment
he
was
again
a
copying-clerk;
but
he
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
table.
"Heaven
help
me!"
cried
he.
"How
did
I
get
up
here--and
so
buried
in
sleep,
too?
After
all,
that
was
a
very
unpleasant,
disagreeable
dream
that
haunted
me!
The
whole
story
is
nothing
but
silly,
stupid
nonsense!"
