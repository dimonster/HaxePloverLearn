The
Best
That
the
Galoshes
Gave
The
following
day,
early
in
the
morning,
while
the
Clerk
was
still
in
bed,
someone
knocked
at
his
door.
It
was
his
neighbor,
a
young
Divine,
who
lived
on
the
same
floor.
He
walked
in.
"Lend
me
your
Galoshes,"
said
he;
"it
is
so
wet
in
the
garden,
though
the
sun
is
shining
most
invitingly.
I
should
like
to
go
out
a
little."
He
got
the
Galoshes,
and
he
was
soon
below
in
a
little
duodecimo
garden,
where
between
two
immense
walls
a
plumtree
and
an
apple-tree
were
standing.
Even
such
a
little
garden
as
this
was
considered
in
the
metropolis
of
Copenhagen
as
a
great
luxury.
The
young
man
wandered
up
and
down
the
narrow
paths,
as
well
as
the
prescribed
limits
would
allow;
the
clock
struck
six;
without
was
heard
the
horn
of
a
post-boy.
"To
travel!
to
travel!"
exclaimed
he,
overcome
by
most
painful
and
passionate
remembrances.
"That
is
the
happiest
thing
in
the
world!
That
is
the
highest
aim
of
all
my
wishes!
Then
at
last
would
the
agonizing
restlessness
be
allayed,
which
destroys
my
existence!
But
it
must
be
far,
far
away!
I
would
behold
magnificent
Switzerland;
I
would
travel
to
Italy,
and--"
It
was
a
good
thing
that
the
power
of
the
Galoshes
worked
as
instantaneously
as
lightning
in
a
powder-magazine
would
do,
otherwise
the
poor
man
with
his
overstrained
wishes
would
have
travelled
about
the
world
too
much
for
himself
as
well
as
for
us.
In
short,
he
was
travelling.
He
was
in
the
middle
of
Switzerland,
but
packed
up
with
eight
other
passengers
in
the
inside
of
an
eternally-creaking
diligence;
his
head
ached
till
it
almost
split,
his
weary
neck
could
hardly
bear
the
heavy
load,
and
his
feet,
pinched
by
his
torturing
boots,
were
terribly
swollen.
He
was
in
an
intermediate
state
between
sleeping
and
waking;
at
variance
with
himself,
with
his
company,
with
the
country,
and
with
the
government.
In
his
right
pocket
he
had
his
letter
of
credit,
in
the
left,
his
passport,
and
in
a
small
leathern
purse
some
double
louis
d'or,
carefully
sewn
up
in
the
bosom
of
his
waistcoat.
Every
dream
proclaimed
that
one
or
the
other
of
these
valuables
was
lost;
wherefore
he
started
up
as
in
a
fever;
and
the
first
movement
which
his
hand
made,
described
a
magic
triangle
from
the
right
pocket
to
the
left,
and
then
up
towards
the
bosom,
to
feel
if
he
had
them
all
safe
or
not.
From
the
roof
inside
the
carriage,
umbrellas,
walking-sticks,
hats,
and
sundry
other
articles
were
depending,
and
hindered
the
view,
which
was
particularly
imposing.
He
now
endeavored
as
well
as
he
was
able
to
dispel
his
gloom,
which
was
caused
by
outward
chance
circumstances
merely,
and
on
the
bosom
of
nature
imbibe
the
milk
of
purest
human
enjoyment.
Grand,
solemn,
and
dark
was
the
whole
landscape
around.
The
gigantic
pine-forests,
on
the
pointed
crags,
seemed
almost
like
little
tufts
of
heather,
colored
by
the
surrounding
clouds.
It
began
to
snow,
a
cold
wind
blew
and
roared
as
though
it
were
seeking
a
bride.
"Augh!"
sighed
he,
"were
we
only
on
the
other
side
the
Alps,
then
we
should
have
summer,
and
I
could
get
my
letters
of
credit
cashed.
The
anxiety
I
feel
about
them
prevents
me
enjoying
Switzerland.
Were
I
but
on
the
other
side!"
And
so
saying
he
was
on
the
other
side
in
Italy,
between
Florence
and
Rome.
Lake
Thracymene,
illumined
by
the
evening
sun,
lay
like
flaming
gold
between
the
dark-blue
mountain-ridges;
here,
where
Hannibal
defeated
Flaminius,
the
rivers
now
held
each
other
in
their
green
embraces;
lovely,
half-naked
children
tended
a
herd
of
black
swine,
beneath
a
group
of
fragrant
laurel-trees,
hard
by
the
road-side.
Could
we
render
this
inimitable
picture
properly,
then
would
everybody
exclaim,
"Beautiful,
unparalleled
Italy!"
But
neither
the
young
Divine
said
so,
nor
anyone
of
his
grumbling
companions
in
the
coach
of
the
vetturino.
The
poisonous
flies
and
gnats
swarmed
around
by
thousands;
in
vain
one
waved
myrtle-branches
about
like
mad;
the
audacious
insect
population
did
not
cease
to
sting;
nor
was
there
a
single
person
in
the
well-crammed
carriage
whose
face
was
not
swollen
and
sore
from
their
ravenous
bites.
The
poor
horses,
tortured
almost
to
death,
suffered
most
from
this
truly
Egyptian
plague;
the
flies
alighted
upon
them
in
large
disgusting
swarms;
and
if
the
coachman
got
down
and
scraped
them
off,
hardly
a
minute
elapsed
before
they
were
there
again.
The
sun
now
set:
a
freezing
cold,
though
of
short
duration
pervaded
the
whole
creation;
it
was
like
a
horrid
gust
coming
from
a
burial-vault
on
a
warm
summer's
day--but
all
around
the
mountains
retained
that
wonderful
green
tone
which
we
see
in
some
old
pictures,
and
which,
should
we
not
have
seen
a
similar
play
of
color
in
the
South,
we
declare
at
once
to
be
unnatural.
It
was
a
glorious
prospect;
but
the
stomach
was
empty,
the
body
tired;
all
that
the
heart
cared
and
longed
for
was
good
night-quarters;
yet
how
would
they
be?
For
these
one
looked
much
more
anxiously
than
for
the
charms
of
nature,
which
every
where
were
so
profusely
displayed.
The
road
led
through
an
olive-grove,
and
here
the
solitary
inn
was
situated.
Ten
or
twelve
crippled-beggars
had
encamped
outside.
The
healthiest
of
them
resembled,
to
use
an
expression
of
Marryat's,
"Hunger's
eldest
son
when
he
had
come
of
age";
the
others
were
either
blind,
had
withered
legs
and
crept
about
on
their
hands,
or
withered
arms
and
fingerless
hands.
It
was
the
most
wretched
misery,
dragged
from
among
the
filthiest
rags.
"Excellenza,
miserabili!"
sighed
they,
thrusting
forth
their
deformed
limbs
to
view.
Even
the
hostess,
with
bare
feet,
uncombed
hair,
and
dressed
in
a
garment
of
doubtful
color,
received
the
guests
grumblingly.
The
doors
were
fastened
with
a
loop
of
string;
the
floor
of
the
rooms
presented
a
stone
paving
half
torn
up;
bats
fluttered
wildly
about
the
ceiling;
and
as
to
the
smell
therein--no--that
was
beyond
description.
"You
had
better
lay
the
cloth
below
in
the
stable,"
said
one
of
the
travellers;
"there,
at
all
events,
one
knows
what
one
is
breathing."
The
windows
were
quickly
opened,
to
let
in
a
little
fresh
air.
Quicker,
however,
than
the
breeze,
the
withered,
sallow
arms
of
the
beggars
were
thrust
in,
accompanied
by
the
eternal
whine
of
"Miserabili,
miserabili,
excellenza!"
On
the
walls
were
displayed
innumerable
inscriptions,
written
in
nearly
every
language
of
Europe,
some
in
verse,
some
in
prose,
most
of
them
not
very
laudatory
of
"bella
Italia."
The
meal
was
served.
It
consisted
of
a
soup
of
salted
water,
seasoned
with
pepper
and
rancid
oil.
The
last
ingredient
played
a
very
prominent
part
in
the
salad;
stale
eggs
and
roasted
cocks'-combs
furnished
the
grand
dish
of
the
repast;
the
wine
even
was
not
without
a
disgusting
taste--it
was
like
a
medicinal
draught.
At
night
the
boxes
and
other
effects
of
the
passengers
were
placed
against
the
rickety
doors.
One
of
the
travellers
kept
watch
while
the
others
slept.
The
sentry
was
our
young
Divine.
How
close
it
was
in
the
chamber!
The
heat
oppressive
to
suffocation--the
gnats
hummed
and
stung
unceasingly--the
"miserabili"
without
whined
and
moaned
in
their
sleep.
"Travelling
would
be
agreeable
enough,"
said
he
groaning,
"if
one
only
had
no
body,
or
could
send
it
to
rest
while
the
spirit
went
on
its
pilgrimage
unhindered,
whither
the
voice
within
might
call
it.
Wherever
I
go,
I
am
pursued
by
a
longing
that
is
insatiable--that
I
cannot
explain
to
myself,
and
that
tears
my
very
heart.
I
want
something
better
than
what
is
but
what
is
fled
in
an
instant.
But
what
is
it,
and
where
is
it
to
be
found?
Yet,
I
know
in
reality
what
it
is
I
wish
for.
Oh!
most
happy
were
I,
could
I
but
reach
one
aim--could
but
reach
the
happiest
of
all!"
And
as
he
spoke
the
word
he
was
again
in
his
home;
the
long
white
curtains
hung
down
from
the
windows,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
stood
the
black
coffin;
in
it
he
lay
in
the
sleep
of
death.
His
wish
was
fulfilled--the
body
rested,
while
the
spirit
went
unhindered
on
its
pilgrimage.
"Let
no
one
deem
himself
happy
before
his
end,"
were
the
words
of
Solon;
and
here
was
a
new
and
brilliant
proof
of
the
wisdom
of
the
old
apothegm.
Every
corpse
is
a
sphynx
of
immortality;
here
too
on
the
black
coffin
the
sphynx
gave
us
no
answer
to
what
he
who
lay
within
had
written
two
days
before:
"O
mighty
Death!
thy
silence
teaches
nought,
Thou
leadest
only
to
the
near
grave's
brink;
Is
broken
now
the
ladder
of
my
thoughts?
Do
I
instead
of
mounting
only
sink?
Our
heaviest
grief
the
world
oft
seeth
not,
Our
sorest
pain
we
hide
from
stranger
eyes:
And
for
the
sufferer
there
is
nothing
left
But
the
green
mound
that
o'er
the
coffin
lies."
Two
figures
were
moving
in
the
chamber.
We
knew
them
both;
it
was
the
fairy
of
Care,
and
the
emissary
of
Fortune.
They
both
bent
over
the
corpse.
"Do
you
now
see,"
said
Care,
"what
happiness
your
Galoshes
have
brought
to
mankind?"
"To
him,
at
least,
who
slumbers
here,
they
have
brought
an
imperishable
blessing,"
answered
the
other.
"Ah
no!"
replied
Care.
"He
took
his
departure
himself;
he
was
not
called
away.
His
mental
powers
here
below
were
not
strong
enough
to
reach
the
treasures
lying
beyond
this
life,
and
which
his
destiny
ordained
he
should
obtain.
I
will
now
confer
a
benefit
on
him."
And
she
took
the
Galoshes
from
his
feet;
his
sleep
of
death
was
ended;
and
he
who
had
been
thus
called
back
again
to
life
arose
from
his
dread
couch
in
all
the
vigor
of
youth.
Care
vanished,
and
with
her
the
Galoshes.
She
has
no
doubt
taken
them
for
herself,
to
keep
them
to
all
eternity.
